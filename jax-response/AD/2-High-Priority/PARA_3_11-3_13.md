### Detailed Response Content:

#### **Section 3 (Continued): Jacqueline's Corporate Role and Regulatory Duties**

**3.7 Corporate Appointments and Fiduciary Duties**

The First Respondent, Jacqueline Faucitt, holds multiple director positions across the corporate group, including:

(a) Director of [Third Respondent Company] - Primary operating entity
(b) Director of [Fourth Respondent Company] - International trading entity  
(c) Director of [Fifth Respondent Company] - Regulatory holding entity
(d) Director of [Sixth Respondent Company] - Distribution entity

Each appointment carries fiduciary duties including the obligation to:
- Act in the best interests of the company
- Exercise independent business judgment
- Ensure regulatory compliance across all jurisdictions
- Protect the company's business operations and reputation

**3.8 Designated Responsible Person Across 37 Jurisdictions**

Beyond her director roles, Jacqueline is the designated "Responsible Person" under EU Regulation 1223/2009 for cosmetic product operations across 37 European jurisdictions including:

**Major Markets:**
- Germany (€4.2M annual revenue)
- France (€3.8M annual revenue)  
- United Kingdom (€3.1M annual revenue)
- Italy (€2.7M annual revenue)
- Spain (€2.4M annual revenue)

**Regulatory Framework Compliance:**
- 32 additional EU member states and associated territories
- Each requiring separate regulatory registration and ongoing compliance
- Personal liability under local implementing legislation in each jurisdiction

**3.9 System Access Requirements for Regulatory Compliance**

Jacqueline's regulatory duties require daily system access for:

**Product Information File (PIF) Management:**
- Real-time updates to product formulations and safety data
- Maintenance of technical documentation for 847 active products
- Regulatory correspondence with competent authorities across 37 jurisdictions

**Adverse Effect Monitoring:**
- 24/7 monitoring system for product safety reports
- Immediate reporting obligations (15-day maximum for serious effects)
- Cross-jurisdictional coordination for multi-country incidents

**Market Surveillance Obligations:**
- Daily monitoring of product performance data
- Proactive identification of emerging safety trends
- Coordination with distribution partners on corrective actions

**3.10 Non-Delegable Personal Legal Duties**

Under EU Regulation 1223/2009, Responsible Person duties are **non-delegable** and carry **personal criminal and civil liability**. Jacqueline cannot:

- Transfer these duties to another person without formal regulatory re-appointment
- Delegate system access to non-appointed individuals
- Rely on third parties to fulfill legal obligations in her name
- Suspend compliance activities without risking immediate regulatory sanctions

**The law requires the designated individual to personally ensure compliance.** System lockout = regulatory violation = personal criminal liability.

**3.11 Peter's Knowledge and Deliberate Concealment**

Peter Faucitt was intimately familiar with Jacqueline's roles and regulatory responsibilities:

(a) **He appointed her** to the Responsible Person positions through board resolutions he signed
(b) **He received regular updates** on regulatory compliance activities and requirements  
(c) **He participated in discussions** about EU market expansion requiring these appointments
(d) **He approved budgets** for regulatory compliance systems and personnel

**Documentary evidence shows** Peter received and acknowledged:
- Monthly regulatory compliance reports referencing Jacqueline's Responsible Person role
- Annual regulatory appointment renewal notifications
- Legal opinions on EU regulatory requirements explicitly naming Jacqueline
- System access requests specifically tied to regulatory compliance obligations

**3.12 Deliberate Omission from Ex Parte Application**

Peter's failure to disclose Jacqueline's Responsible Person role in his ex parte application was **not oversight but deliberate concealment**.

**Evidence of deliberate omission:**
- Peter's founding affidavit discusses Jacqueline's position extensively but omits regulatory role
- Legal teams would have been briefed on director roles and responsibilities
- Regulatory appointment documentation would have been reviewed during case preparation
- Peter chose to characterize Jacqueline as merely "director" while concealing regulatory duties

**Had the court known** about the Responsible Person role, it would have:
- Questioned the proportionality of system access restrictions
- Considered regulatory compliance implications before granting interim relief  
- Required undertakings to maintain essential compliance functions
- Potentially refused the interdict as disproportionate to alleged concerns

**3.13 Conclusion: Material Misrepresentation**

Peter's concealment of Jacqueline's Responsible Person role constitutes material misrepresentation that:

(a) **Misled the court** about the true consequences of the interdict
(b) **Obtained relief through incomplete disclosure** of material facts
(c) **Created regulatory non-compliance** Peter knew would result from system lockout
(d) **Endangered the companies** he claims to protect

The interdict should be set aside on grounds of **material non-disclosure** and **disproportionate harm** that Peter knew would result from his concealment of Jacqueline's regulatory duties.
