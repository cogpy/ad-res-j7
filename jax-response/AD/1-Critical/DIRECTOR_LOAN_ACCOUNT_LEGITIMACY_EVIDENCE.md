# DIRECTOR LOAN ACCOUNT LEGITIMACY EVIDENCE

## Purpose

This document provides comprehensive evidence and legal framework demonstrating the legitimacy of the R500,000 payment to Jacqueline Faucitt on 16 July 2025 as a routine director loan account transaction.

---

## 1. LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR DIRECTOR LOAN ACCOUNTS

### 1.1 Close Corporations Act 69 of 1984

**Relevant Provisions:**
- Section 42: Members may draw remuneration or other benefits as determined by members
- Section 50: Accounting records must be kept showing financial position
- **No requirement for board resolutions for routine director loan account transactions**

### 1.2 Companies Act 71 of 2008 (if applicable)

**Relevant Provisions:**
- Section 45: Financial assistance to directors (requires special resolution for material assistance)
- **Director loan accounts where company owes director**: Not financial assistance TO director, but repayment OF amounts owed by company
- Directors routinely build up credit balances through:
  - Unpaid remuneration
  - Personal funds advanced to company
  - Expenses paid personally on behalf of company
  - Services rendered but not immediately withdrawn

### 1.3 Legal Distinction: Credit vs Debit Balance

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

| Scenario | Nature | Legal Treatment |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Company owes Director** (Credit balance) | Company debt to director | Director entitled to withdraw - **NO special approval required** |
| **Director owes Company** (Debit balance) | Financial assistance to director | May require resolution/approval under s45 |

**The R500K payment was withdrawal from CREDIT balance - company paying what it owed to director.**

---

## 2. DIRECTOR LOAN ACCOUNT STRUCTURE

### 2.1 Existence of Director Loan Accounts

**All three directors maintain director loan accounts:**

| Director | Account Balance (as of [DATE]) | Status | Evidence Reference |
|----------|--------------------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Peter Faucitt (Applicant) | R[X] million | CREDIT (company owes director) | **Annexure JF-DLA1** |
| Jacqueline Faucitt (First Respondent) | R[X] million | CREDIT (company owes director) | **Annexure JF-DLA2** |
| Daniel Faucitt (Second Respondent) | R[X] million | CREDIT (company owes director) | **Annexure JF-DLA3** |

**Key Point:** ALL directors have substantial CREDIT balances, meaning the companies owe each director millions of rand at all times.

### 2.2 How Director Loan Accounts Accumulate Credit Balances

**Typical sources of credit balance accumulation:**

1. **Unpaid Remuneration/Distributions**
   - Directors entitled to remuneration for services
   - Not always withdrawn immediately
   - Accumulates as credit balance

2. **Personal Funds Advanced**
   - Directors use personal funds for business expenses
   - Company owes reimbursement
   - Creates credit balance

3. **Services Rendered**
   - Work performed for the business
   - Value credited to director loan account
   - Withdrawn when convenient

4. **Trust Distributions**
   - If entities operate as trusts
   - Distributions allocated to beneficiaries
   - May be left in account rather than immediately withdrawn

**Evidence Required:**
- Historical accounting records showing accumulation pattern (**Annexure JF-DLA-HISTORY**)
- Examples of credit balance sources for each director
- Accounting policies document

## 3. ESTABLISHED PRACTICE FOR DIRECTOR LOAN TRANSACTIONS

   - No historical objections until current dispute

### 3.2 Legal Justification for No Board Resolutions

**Why board resolutions are NOT required:**

1. **Close Corporation Structure:**
   - Less formal than companies
   - Members (directors) have direct authority
   - Members' agreement governs internal affairs

   - Company paying debt it owes
   - Not granting new benefit or assistance
   - Director exercising existing entitlement

3. **Established Commercial Practice:**
   - Industry standard for close corporations

   - Preserves business flexibility

4. **Universal Director Participation:**

## 5. PETER'S INCONSISTENT POSITION - CRITICAL EVIDENCE

### 5.1 Peter's Own Similar Withdrawals

**Peter has made similar withdrawals without board resolutions:**

| Date | Amount | Reference | Evidence |
|------|--------|-----------|----------|
| [Date 1] | R[amount] | [Reference] | **Annexure JF-PA1** |
| [Date 2] | R[amount] | [Reference] | **Annexure JF-PA2** |
| [Date 3] | R[amount] | [Reference] | **Annexure JF-PA3** |
| [Date 4] | R[amount] | [Reference] | **Annexure JF-PA4** |

**Evidence to Obtain:**
- MINIMUM 4 examples of Peter's withdrawals without board resolutions
- Prefer examples of comparable or larger amounts
- Show date, amount, bank reference
- Demonstrate same informal process

### 5.2 Peter's Acceptance of Practice

**Evidence of Peter's participation in informal model:**

1. **Historical Withdrawals:**
   - Never requested board resolutions for his own withdrawals
   - Used same informal process
   - Benefited from flexible arrangement

2. **No Prior Objections:**
   - Never objected to practice over [X] years
   - Never characterized others' withdrawals as "unauthorized"
   - Never proposed formal resolution requirement

3. **Sudden Change of Position:**
   - Only objected after [date/event]
   - Timing suggests pretext
   - Inconsistent with decades of acceptance

### 5.3 Hypocrisy Argument

**Peter's position is fundamentally hypocritical:**

| Peter's Actions | Peter's Current Allegations |
|----------------|----------------------------|
| Made similar withdrawals without resolutions | Claims R500K withdrawal "unauthorized" |
| Accepted informal practice for decades | Now demands formal board resolutions |
| Benefited from flexible arrangement | Characterizes others' use as misconduct |
| Never objected to practice | Claims practice was always improper |

**This inconsistency demonstrates allegation is pretextual, not genuine concern about corporate governance.**

## 6. TIMING ANALYSIS - EVIDENCE OF PRETEXT

### 6.1 Timeline

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 16 July 2025 | R500K payment processed | Routine director loan transaction |
| 5 August 2025 | Peter consults attorneys | 20 days AFTER payment |
| 13 August 2025 | Ex parte interdict filed | 28 days AFTER payment |

### 6.2 Why Timing Demonstrates Pretext

1. **No Immediate Objection:**
   - Peter did not object at time of transaction
   - Did not request reversal
   - Did not call emergency meeting

2. **Delay Suggests Strategic Use:**
   - Payment used as ammunition for litigation
   - Not genuine concern about unauthorized transaction
   - If truly unauthorized, immediate action expected

3. **Context of Settlement Negotiations:**
   - Payment occurred during [settlement context]
   - Peter's litigation coincides with [related events]
   - Suggests payment used as pretext for other agenda

**Evidence Required:**
- Timeline documentation (**Annexure JF-TIMELINE**)
- Evidence of settlement negotiations/disputes preceding payment
- Communications showing Peter's awareness of payment vs timing of objection

## 7. BUSINESS PURPOSE AND COMMERCIAL JUSTIFICATION

1. **Compensation for Services:**
   - Jacqueline's work as Responsible Person across 37 jurisdictions
   - Management of international e-commerce operations
   - Customer service and relationship management
   - Regulatory compliance work

2. **Trust Distributions (if applicable):**
   - If entities operate as trusts
   - Distributions to beneficiaries are legally required

## 9. LEGAL ARGUMENTS SUMMARY

### 9.1 Positive Case (Why Payment is Legitimate)

1. **Legal Entitlement:** Company owed Jacqueline money (credit balance), she was entitled to withdraw
2. **Established Practice:** Consistent with decades of accepted practice by all directors
3. **Proper Process:** Transparent bank references, proper accounting allocation, reconciled correctly
4. **No Approval Required:** Credit balance withdrawals don't require board resolutions under close corporation law
5. **Business Purpose:** Multiple legitimate purposes (compensation, distributions, reimbursement)

### 9.2 Defensive Case (Why Peter's Allegation Fails)

1. **Hypocrisy:** Peter made identical withdrawals without resolutions
2. **Inconsistency:** Peter accepted practice for decades, sudden objection is pretextual
3. **Timing:** 20-day delay before objection suggests strategic use, not genuine concern
4. **Selective Application:** Peter applies different standard to others than to himself
5. **Bad Faith:** Allegation weaponizes previously acceptable practice for litigation advantage

### 9.3 Counter-Attack (Turn Peter's Allegation Against Him)

**Peter's allegation backfires because:**
- Exposes his own participation in allegedly "improper" practice
- Demonstrates his acceptance and benefit from flexible arrangement
- Highlights his inconsistent position and bad faith
- Shows he's manufacturing misconduct allegations from routine transactions
