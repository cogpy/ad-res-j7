## Jax's Response Strategy

**AD PARAGRAPH 7.6**

### Key Points to Address:
- [x] Identify factual inaccuracies - Payment must be evaluated in context of trust distributions
- [x] Provide counter-evidence - RWD revenue integrity questions
- [x] Expose material non-disclosures - Peter fails to address RWD payment obligations
- [x] Demonstrate Peter's inconsistency - Questions single payment while ignoring systematic non-payment to distributor
- [x] Reference supporting annexures - RWD_REVENUE_INTEGRITY_ANALYSIS.md

### Recommended Approach:

**Counter-Argument Framework:**

Peter's allegations about a R500,000 payment ignore fundamental questions about RWD's revenue integrity and payment obligations. Before Peter can characterize this payment as unauthorized, he must address:

1. **Trust Structure Context**
   - If RWD operates as a trust vehicle (like RegimA SA), the payment must be evaluated as potential trust distribution
   - Peter fails to clarify whether RWD holds funds in trust or appropriates them
   - Trust distributions are not "unauthorized payments" but fiduciary obligations

2. **Systematic Non-Payment to Distributor**
   - RWD paid manufacturer (RegimA Skin Treatments) for years
   - RWD NEVER paid distributor (Daniel's UK entities) despite all sales occurring on distributor's platform
   - Daniel's UK company funded Shopify platform: R140K-R280K over 28 months
   - No compensation ever provided to platform owner

3. **Revenue Legitimacy Questions**
   - RWD holds no stock, no inventory, no assets to generate independent revenue
   - All sales occurred on platform owned and paid for by Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd)
   - How can Peter question one R500K payment while ignoring systematic failure to compensate platform owner?

4. **Unjust Enrichment**
   - If payment to Jax is "unauthorized," then RWD's appropriation of revenue from Daniel's platform without payment is massive unjust enrichment
   - Platform usage fees owed: R140K-R280K minimum
   - Total potential claim against RWD: R2.94M - R6.88M

**Strategic Response:**
> "Peter's allegations about a R500,000 payment must be evaluated in context of RWD's revenue integrity and payment obligations. If RWD operates as a trust, this payment may be a legitimate trust distribution. More critically, Peter ignores RWD's systematic failure to compensate Daniel's UK entity for 28 months of platform costs (R140K-R280K) despite all RWD 'revenue' occurring on Daniel's platform. Peter cannot characterize one payment as unauthorized while ignoring RWD's appropriation of revenue from a platform it never compensated."
