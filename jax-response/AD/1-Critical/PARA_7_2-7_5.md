## Jax's Response Strategy

**AD PARAGRAPH 7.2 TO 7.5**

### Key Points to Address:
- [ ] Identify factual inaccuracies
- [ ] Provide counter-evidence
- [ ] Expose material non-disclosures
- [ ] Demonstrate Peter's inconsistency
- [ ] Reference supporting annexures

### Recommended Approach:

**Contextualize IT Expenses Within International Operations:**
- Detail RegimA's operations across 37 international jurisdictions requiring substantial IT infrastructure
- Provide itemized breakdown of IT expenses by category (Shopify Plus, AWS, Microsoft 365, Adobe, Sage, payment gateways)
- **Include comparative analysis showing IT spend as percentage of revenue is industry-standard for e-commerce (typically 5-10% of revenue)**
- Demonstrate how Peter's card cancellations created the documentation gap
- Add Dan's technical affidavit explaining infrastructure requirements and technical justification

**Strategic Points:**
- Expose Peter's restriction of access to documentation, then claiming it doesn't exist
- Show IT expenses are legitimate business expenses for international operations
- Demonstrate expenses are proportionate to revenue and consistent with industry benchmarks
- Highlight that international payments are normal for global business operations

### Evidence Required:
- [ ] Itemized IT expense breakdown by category (JF5)
- [ ] Shopify Plus subscription invoices and usage reports (JF5A)
- [ ] AWS/cloud hosting invoices and infrastructure diagrams (JF5B)
- [ ] Microsoft 365 Business licenses for all staff (JF5C)
- [ ] Adobe Creative Cloud for marketing materials (JF5D)
- [ ] Sage accounting software invoices (JF5E)
