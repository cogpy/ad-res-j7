**3. Demonstrate How Peter Created Documentation Gap**

Timeline of Peter's Obstructive Actions:
- Mid-June 2025: Daniel provides reports to accountant (cooperation)
- **Next Day**: Peter secretly cancels all business cards (sabotage)
- June 2025: Services halted, domains lapsed, email systems down
- 19 August 2025: Ex parte interdict blocks system access
- **Result**: Peter created the "missing documentation" he now complains about

**4. Industry Benchmark Comparison**

- RegimA IT Spend: ~10-11% of revenue
- Industry Average (International E-commerce): 8-15% of revenue
- **Conclusion**: RegimA's IT expenses are within normal industry parameters
