# AD PARAGRAPH Response Structure

This directory contains Peter Faucitt's founding affidavit claims organized by priority rating for systematic rebuttal.

---

## Priority Rating System

### Priority 1 - Critical (5 paragraphs)
**Must be comprehensively rebutted with strong evidence**

Core financial misconduct allegations that form the foundation of Peter's case. These require detailed, evidence-based responses with multiple supporting annexures.

### Priority 2 - High Priority (8 paragraphs)
**Require strong responses with supporting evidence**

Claims affecting credibility, authority, and the narrative of events. These support the critical allegations and must be addressed to undermine Peter's overall case.

### Priority 3 - Medium Priority (19 paragraphs)
**Require adequate responses**

Supporting allegations and contextual claims. While not central to the case, these fill out Peter's narrative and should be addressed to prevent them from being accepted by default.

### Priority 4 - Low Priority (17 paragraphs)
**Brief responses sufficient**

Procedural matters and formal claims that don't require extensive rebuttal. Simple admissions or denials with brief explanations are adequate.

### Priority 5 - Meaningless (1 paragraph)
**Minimal or no response needed**

Purely formal or irrelevant claims that have no substantive impact on the case.

### PARA_7_6 - R500K Payment
