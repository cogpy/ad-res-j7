## 5. IMPACT OF APPLICANT'S CARD CANCELLATIONS

### 5.1 Timeline of Service Disruptions

5.1.1 On or about **[DATE]**, the Applicant unilaterally cancelled business credit cards that were used for recurring IT service payments.

5.1.2 This action caused **immediate payment failures** for the following critical services:

**(a) Cloud Storage and Document Management:**
- Google Workspace payment failure: [DATE]
- Microsoft 365 payment failure: [DATE]
- Dropbox Business payment failure: [DATE]
- **Result:** Loss of access to invoices, financial records, and regulatory documentation

**(b) Accounting and Financial Systems:**
- Sage subscription payment failure: [DATE]
- QuickBooks payment failure: [DATE]
- **Result:** Loss of access to complete financial records and transaction history

**(c) E-Commerce Platform:**

**(d) Cloud Infrastructure:**
- AWS payment failure: [DATE]
- **Result:** Risk of service termination and complete website shutdown

### 5.2 Creation of Documentation Gap

5.2.1 The Applicant's card cancellations **directly created the documentation gap** he now complains about:

**(a) Invoices and Receipts:**
- Stored in Google Workspace (access lost due to payment failure)
- Stored in Microsoft 365 (access lost due to payment failure)
- Stored in Dropbox Business (access lost due to payment failure)

**(b) Financial Records:**

## 6. TECHNICAL NECESSITY OF IT INFRASTRUCTURE

### 6.1 Non-Discretionary Requirements

6.1.1 The IT infrastructure detailed above is **not optional or discretionary**. It is:

**(a) Legally Required:**
- PCI-DSS compliance for payment processing (legal requirement)
- GDPR compliance for EU customer data (legal requirement)
- POPIA compliance for SA customer data (legal requirement)
- Regulatory documentation systems for Responsible Person role (legal requirement)

**(b) Operationally Essential:**
- E-commerce platform required to generate revenue
- Payment gateways required to process customer transactions
- Cloud infrastructure required for website availability
- Accounting systems required for financial compliance

**(c) Commercially Standard:**
- All systems used are industry-standard platforms
- Costs are within industry norms for international e-commerce
- No excessive or luxury expenditures

### 6.2 Impossibility of Reduction

6.2.1 The IT expenses **cannot be materially reduced** without:
- Ceasing international operations (loss of 90%+ of revenue)
- Violating regulatory compliance requirements (criminal liability)
- Shutting down e-commerce operations (complete business failure)
- Breaching data protection laws (substantial penalties)

6.2.2 Any suggestion that these expenses are "excessive" or "unexplained" demonstrates **fundamental misunderstanding** of international e-commerce operations.

---

## 7. RESPONSE TO APPLICANT'S ALLEGATIONS

### 7.1 "Unexplained" IT Expenses

7.1.1 The Applicant characterizes IT expenses as "unexplained." This is **factually incorrect**:
- Every expense category is explained above
- Every expense is justified by business necessity
- Every expense is within industry norms
- Every expense is supported by invoices and contracts

7.1.2 The expenses are only "unexplained" to the Applicant because:
- He lacks technical knowledge of IT infrastructure requirements
- He refuses to acknowledge the scope of international operations
- He created the documentation gap through card cancellations
- He has not requested or reviewed the detailed breakdowns available

### 7.2 International Supplier Payments

7.2.1 The Applicant suggests that payments to international suppliers are suspicious. This is **absurd**:
- Shopify is a Canadian company (industry-leading e-commerce platform)
- Microsoft is a US company (industry-standard business software)
- Adobe is a US company (industry-standard design software)
- AWS is a US company (industry-leading cloud infrastructure)

7.2.2 **There are no South African equivalents** for these essential international platforms.

7.2.3 Operating internationally **requires** international suppliers. This is not evidence of misconduct but evidence of **legitimate international business operations**.

### 7.3 Foreign Payment Quota Utilization

7.3.1 The Applicant cites 80% utilization of foreign payment quota as evidence of misconduct.

7.3.2 This is **evidence of legitimate international business activity**:
- International software subscriptions (Shopify, AWS, Microsoft, Adobe)
- Payment gateway fees for processing international customer transactions
- International domain registrations and hosting
- Regulatory compliance services in foreign jurisdictions
- Marketing and advertising in international markets

7.3.3 **80% utilization is entirely appropriate** for a business operating in 37 international jurisdictions.

---

## 8. CONCLUSION

8.1 The IT expenses alleged by the Applicant are:
- **Fully explained** by the itemized breakdown above
- **Justified** by business necessity and regulatory requirements
- **Within industry norms** for international e-commerce operations
- **Supported** by invoices, contracts, and usage records

8.2 The Applicant's characterization of these expenses as "questionable" or "unexplained" is:
- **Factually incorrect**
- **Demonstrative of lack of technical knowledge**
- **Contradicted by industry standards and benchmarks**

8.3 The Applicant's card cancellations:
- **Created the documentation gap** he now complains about
- **Disrupted critical business systems**
- **Required emergency personal funding** to prevent business collapse

8.4 I am available to provide:
- Complete invoices and contracts for all IT services
- Detailed usage reports and analytics
- Technical architecture documentation
- Industry benchmark comparisons
- Expert testimony on IT infrastructure requirements

8.5 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court:

- **Consider the Applicant's role** in creating the documentation gap
- **Grant the relief sought** in the Answering Affidavit
