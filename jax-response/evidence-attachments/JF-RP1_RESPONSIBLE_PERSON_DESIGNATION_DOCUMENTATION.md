### Legal Obligations
The Responsible Person designation creates non-delegable duties including:

   - Implement corrective actions immediately when required

4. **Market Surveillance**

### Personal Liability Exposure

- **Market Prohibition**: Products banned from sale in affected jurisdictions

## System Access Requirements

To fulfill Responsible Person duties, continuous access is required to:

   - Quality control records

2. **Regulatory Compliance Platforms**

## Impact of Interdict

The interdict granted on 19 August 2025 prevents access to all systems required for Responsible Person duties, creating:

1. **Immediate Compliance Violations**

   - Cannot access Product Information Files
   - Cannot implement required corrective actions
   - Cannot report adverse events

2. **Escalating Legal Exposure**
   - Daily accumulation of violations
   - Increasing penalty exposure
   - Growing personal liability risk
   - Potential criminal prosecution

3. **Business Destruction Risk**
   - Products may be ordered off market
   - Import/export authorizations suspended
   - Distributor relationships terminated
   - Brand reputation irreparably damaged

## Material Non-Disclosure

Peter Faucitt's failure to disclose this critical information in his ex parte application constitutes material non-disclosure because:

1. **Known or Should Have Known**
   - Responsible Person role documented in company records
   - Publicly available information (regulatory databases)
   - Fundamental to international operations
   - Discussed in board meetings

2. **Material to Relief Sought**
   - Interdict directly prevents regulatory compliance
   - Creates immediate legal crisis
   - Exposes Jacqueline to personal criminal liability
   - Threatens entire international business

3. **Would Have Affected Court's Decision**
   - Court unaware of regulatory crisis created
   - No consideration of personal liability exposure
   - No balancing of competing harms
   - No provision for regulatory compliance

## Conclusion

This documentation establishes that:

1. Jacqueline Faucitt holds Responsible Person designation in 37 jurisdictions
2. This role carries non-delegable duties and personal legal liability
3. The interdict prevents fulfillment of these legal obligations
4. Immediate regulatory crisis exists requiring urgent relief
5. Material non-disclosure vitiates the ex parte interdict
