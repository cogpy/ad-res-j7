### 10.2 Context for Reported IT Expenses

10.2.1 The Applicant reports IT expenses of:
   - 2024: R6,738,007.47
   - 2025 (year-to-date): R2,116,159.47

10.2.2 Based on the infrastructure requirements detailed above, these expenses fall **within the expected range** for a business of our scale and complexity.

10.2.3 The 2024 expenses (R6,738,007.47) represent approximately **5.2% of our estimated annual revenue** of R130 million from international e-commerce operations.

10.2.4 Industry benchmarks for e-commerce companies typically show IT spending of **5-10% of revenue**, meaning our spending is at the **lower end of industry norms** for businesses of similar scope.

## 11. INDUSTRY BENCHMARKS AND JUSTIFICATION

### 11.1 E-Commerce IT Spending Benchmarks

11.1.1 According to industry research:
   - E-commerce companies typically spend **5-10% of revenue** on IT infrastructure
   - Multi-jurisdictional operations increase IT costs by **30-50%** compared to single-market operations
   - Highly regulated industries (like cosmetics) require an additional **20-30%** in compliance-related IT spending

11.1.2 Based on these benchmarks, our IT spending is **appropriate and justified** for:
   - 37-jurisdiction international operations
   - Highly regulated cosmetics industry
   - E-commerce-first business model
   - Complex regulatory compliance requirements

### 11.2 Cost-Benefit Analysis

11.2.1 Our IT infrastructure enables:
   - **R130 million+ in annual revenue** from international markets
   - **99.9% uptime** for e-commerce operations, minimizing lost sales
   - **Regulatory compliance** across 37 jurisdictions, avoiding fines and market exclusion
   - **Customer data protection**, maintaining trust and legal compliance
   - **Operational efficiency**, reducing manual processes and errors

11.2.2 The return on IT investment is substantial, with each R1 spent on IT infrastructure supporting approximately **R19 in revenue**.

### 11.3 Comparison to Alternative Approaches

11.3.1 Alternative approaches would be:
   - **Manual processes**: Would require 20-30 additional full-time employees, costing R6-9 million annually in salaries alone, plus increased error rates and compliance risks
   - **Single-market focus**: Would eliminate 80%+ of revenue by abandoning international markets
   - **Non-compliance**: Would result in market exclusion, regulatory fines, and potential criminal liability

11.3.2 The current IT infrastructure represents the **most cost-effective approach** to supporting our international operations.

## 12. IMPACT OF APPLICANT'S ACTIONS ON IT INFRASTRUCTURE

### 12.1 Payment Card Cancellations (June 2025)

12.1.1 In June 2025, the Applicant unilaterally cancelled company payment cards that were used for IT service payments.

12.1.2 This action resulted in:
   - **Domain registration lapses**: Loss of access to critical domains
   - **Email service terminations**: Disruption of business communications
   - **Cloud storage suspensions**: Loss of access to business documents and records
   - **Payment gateway suspensions**: Disruption of e-commerce transactions
   - **Security service lapses**: Increased vulnerability to cyber threats

12.1.3 I personally funded the restoration of critical services using my own funds to prevent:
   - Complete business shutdown
   - Loss of customer data
   - Regulatory compliance violations
   - Irreparable damage to customer relationships

12.1.4 The Applicant's actions created the very documentation gaps he later complained about, as access to cloud-based financial and operational records was lost due to his payment card cancellations.

### 12.2 System Access Restrictions

12.2.1 The Applicant has systematically restricted access to IT systems, including:
   - Financial management systems (Sage)
   - Email accounts and communications
   - Cloud storage and document repositories
   - CRM and customer databases

12.2.2 These restrictions prevent me from:
   - Fulfilling my operational responsibilities as CIO
   - Providing comprehensive documentation in response to allegations
   - Maintaining business continuity
   - Ensuring regulatory compliance

### 12.3 Fabricated Documentation Gaps

12.3.1 The Applicant complains about lack of documentation for IT expenses while simultaneously:
   - Cancelling the payment methods used for IT services
   - Restricting access to the systems that contain IT service invoices and contracts
   - Preventing access to email records containing vendor communications

12.3.2 This represents a pattern of creating problems and then using those problems as justification for further actions against the business and its directors.

## 13. IMPACT OF CURRENT INTERDICT

### 13.1 Operational Continuity Threatened

13.1.1 The current interdict prevents me from:
   - Accessing financial systems needed to authorize IT infrastructure payments
   - Making critical decisions about IT security and infrastructure
   - Responding to technical emergencies or system outages
   - Fulfilling my fiduciary duties as a director

13.1.2 This creates immediate risks:
   - **Service disruptions**: Inability to renew expiring services or resolve technical issues
   - **Security vulnerabilities**: Delayed response to cyber threats or security incidents
   - **Compliance violations**: Inability to maintain required systems for regulatory compliance
   - **Revenue loss**: Potential e-commerce downtime affecting R130 million in annual sales

### 13.2 Compliance Consequences

13.2.1 IT infrastructure is critical to regulatory compliance:
   - **GDPR compliance**: Requires specific technical controls and systems
   - **PCI-DSS compliance**: Requires specific payment security measures
   - **Product safety systems**: Requires databases and tracking systems for consumer protection
   - **Financial reporting**: Requires accounting and ERP systems for accurate records

13.2.2 Disruption of IT infrastructure could result in:
   - Regulatory fines (€10,000 to €1,000,000 per jurisdiction)
   - Loss of market access (inability to sell in EU or other regulated markets)
   - Personal liability for directors (GDPR, product safety regulations)
   - Criminal penalties for compliance failures

### 13.3 Customer Impact

13.3.1 IT infrastructure disruption directly affects customers:
   - **E-commerce downtime**: Customers unable to place orders
   - **Payment processing failures**: Customers unable to complete purchases
   - **Customer service disruption**: Inability to respond to inquiries or complaints
   - **Data protection failures**: Risk to customer personal information

13.3.2 This could result in:
   - Irreparable damage to brand reputation
   - Loss of customer trust and loyalty
   - Customer complaints to regulatory authorities
   - Potential class-action litigation for data protection failures

## 14. DOCUMENTATION AND TRANSPARENCY

### 14.1 Cooperation with Documentation Requests

14.1.1 I have consistently provided documentation when requested and when access to systems was available.

14.1.2 Any gaps in documentation are directly attributable to:
   - The Applicant's payment card cancellations disrupting access to vendor records
   - The Applicant's system access restrictions preventing retrieval of invoices and contracts
   - The ex parte nature of the interdict, which prevented advance preparation of comprehensive documentation

14.1.3 I am willing and able to provide comprehensive IT infrastructure documentation once access to systems is restored and reasonable time is provided.

### 14.2 Legitimate Business Purpose

14.2.1 Every IT expense serves a legitimate business purpose:
   - Supporting R130 million in annual e-commerce revenue
   - Ensuring regulatory compliance across 37 jurisdictions
   - Protecting customer data and privacy
   - Maintaining operational efficiency and business continuity
   - Enabling growth and competitive advantage

14.2.2 There are no "unexplained" IT expenses - only expenses that the Applicant chooses not to understand or acknowledge.

### 14.3 Historical Pattern of Transparent Management

14.3.1 For decades, the companies have operated with informal but transparent management practices:
   - Directors made operational decisions without formal board resolutions for routine matters
   - All directors participated in and benefited from these informal practices
   - Financial records were maintained in Sage and available to all directors
   - No concerns were raised about IT spending until the current dispute

14.3.2 The Applicant's sudden objection to established IT spending patterns represents a departure from decades of collaborative management, not a discovery of impropriety.

## 15. CONCLUSION

15.1 The IT expenses cited by the Applicant are **not "unexplained"** - they are necessary, justified, and appropriate for a multi-jurisdictional e-commerce business in a highly regulated industry.

15.2 Our IT spending of approximately 5.2% of revenue is **at the lower end of industry benchmarks** for e-commerce companies (5-10% typical), demonstrating efficient and cost-effective management.

15.3 The Applicant's characterization of these expenses as improper reflects either:
   - A fundamental misunderstanding of the technical requirements of our international operations, or
   - A deliberate misrepresentation designed to create a false impression of financial misconduct

15.4 The Applicant's own actions - cancelling payment cards and restricting system access - created the documentation gaps he now complains about.

15.5 The current interdict threatens:
   - Operational continuity of R130 million in annual e-commerce operations
   - Regulatory compliance across 37 jurisdictions
   - Customer data protection and service quality
   - The ability of directors to fulfill their fiduciary duties

15.6 I am prepared to provide any additional documentation or explanation regarding IT infrastructure once reasonable access to systems is restored and adequate time is provided.
