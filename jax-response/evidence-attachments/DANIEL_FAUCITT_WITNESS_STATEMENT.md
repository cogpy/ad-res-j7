## DECLARATION

I, Daniel James Faucitt, do hereby make oath and state that:

1. I am an adult male and the Second Respondent in the above matter.

2. The facts contained in this statement are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are to the best of my knowledge and belief both true and correct.

3. Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.

---

## SECTION 1: BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

### 1.1 My Role and Responsibilities

4. I am the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the RegimA Group of companies, primarily directing RegimA Skin Treatments (Pty) Ltd ("RST").

5. I am also a director of RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd ("RWW") and a member of Strategic Logistics Group CC ("SLG").

6. Through my UK company, RegimA Zone Ltd (which is independent of RegimA UK Ltd), I own and pay for the e-commerce Shopify platforms used by multiple entities, including:
   - RegimA Worldwide Distribution (South Africa)
   - RegimA Zone (South Africa)
   - RegimA SA (South Africa)
   - Other entities in the E-Commerce Automation Platform

7. I have been responsible for building and managing the IT infrastructure that has enabled the RegimA Group's international expansion to 37 jurisdictions and revenue growth from R2.1 million (2022) to R19.1 million (2024) - a 809% increase over three years.

---

### 1.2 Historical Relationship with Peter Faucitt

8. Peter Faucitt ("Peter") is my father and the Applicant in this matter.

9. For many years, Peter and I worked together in the family business. Peter had full access to all financial information through:
   - Annual financial statements prepared by the accountant, Daniel Jacobus Bantjes
   - Regular informal discussions about business operations
   - Access to the accountant for any queries or concerns
   - His role as trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust with absolute powers

10. Peter participated in the same informal director loan account practices that he now objects to. He made withdrawals from director loan accounts without board resolutions for years, just as all other directors did.

11. Peter was fully aware of the IT expenses and international operations for years. The financial statements showed IT expenses annually, and Peter never raised any objections until August 2025.

---

## SECTION 2: THE "HAS ANYTHING CHANGED?" EXCHANGE

### 2.1 Date and Context

12. In or around early June 2025, Peter approached me and asked: **"Has anything changed?"**

13. This question occurred after I had provided comprehensive business reports to the accountant, Daniel Jacobus Bantjes, on June 6, 2025, as part of routine tax season preparation.

14. The question also occurred shortly after Peter had secretly cancelled all business bank cards on or around June 7, 2025, without warning or discussion with me or my mother, Jacqueline Faucitt ("Jax").

---

### 2.2 The Question: "Has Anything Changed?"

15. Peter's question was: **"Has anything changed?"**

16. The tone and manner of Peter's question was **menacing and confrontational**, not genuinely inquisitive.

17. Peter's question was rhetorical - he already knew that nothing had changed in our business operations, financial arrangements, or IT infrastructure.

18. Peter had full knowledge of:
   - The director loan account practices (he participated in them himself)
   - The IT expenses (shown in financial statements for years)
   - The international operations (37 jurisdictions, ongoing for years)
   - The e-commerce platform structure (Shopify, AWS, etc.)
   - All financial arrangements (through accountant and financial statements)

19. Peter's question demonstrated that he knew nothing had changed, yet he was preparing to take drastic action based on alleged "new discoveries" of financial irregularities.

---

### 2.3 My Response

20. I responded to Peter's question by explaining that nothing had changed in our business operations.

21. I confirmed that:
   - Business operations continued as they had for years
   - IT infrastructure remained the same (necessary for 37-jurisdiction operations)
   - Director loan account practices continued as established
   - Financial arrangements remained consistent with historical practice

22. I was confused by Peter's question because nothing had changed, and Peter had full knowledge of all business arrangements for years.

23. I did not understand at the time that Peter was preparing to file an interdict based on alleged "new discoveries" of financial irregularities that he had known about for years.

---

### 2.4 Significance of the Exchange

24. Peter's question **"Has anything changed?"** is highly significant because it demonstrates:

   **a) Peter's Knowledge:** Peter knew that nothing had changed. He had full knowledge of all business arrangements for years.

   **b) Manufactured Urgency:** Peter's subsequent interdict (filed August 13, 2025) claimed urgent action was needed to address newly discovered financial irregularities. But Peter's own question demonstrates he knew nothing had changed.

   **c) Bad Faith:** Peter acknowledged that nothing had changed, yet proceeded to file an interdict claiming urgent new concerns. This demonstrates bad faith and manufactured justification.

   **d) Strategic Timing:** Peter's question occurred shortly after:
      - June 6, 2025: I provided comprehensive reports to Bantjes
      - June 7, 2025: Peter cancelled all business bank cards
      - This demonstrates Peter was preparing his interdict strategy, not reacting to new information.

25. Peter's question contradicts his founding affidavit allegations of "recently discovering" financial irregularities requiring urgent action.

---

## SECTION 3: EVENTS LEADING TO THE EXCHANGE

### 3.1 June 6, 2025: Comprehensive Reports to Bantjes

26. On June 6, 2025, I provided comprehensive business reports to the accountant, Daniel Jacobus Bantjes, as part of routine tax season preparation.

27. These reports included:
   - Complete business operations report
   - Financial summaries for all business entities
   - Transaction records for the review period
   - Operational context for tax preparation
   - Business structure documentation
   - Revenue and expense overviews

28. This was routine cooperation with the accountant during tax season. I provided all requested information for legitimate tax preparation purposes.

29. Peter was aware that I had provided these comprehensive reports to Bantjes, as Bantjes is Peter's personal accountant and Peter had full access to all information provided.

---

### 3.2 June 7, 2025: Card Cancellations

30. On or around June 7, 2025 (one day after I provided comprehensive reports to Bantjes), Peter secretly cancelled all business bank cards without warning or discussion.

31. The card cancellations caused:
   - Payment failures for critical cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft 365)
   - Service suspensions cutting off access to documentation systems
   - Operational chaos and business disruption
   - Loss of access to invoices, receipts, and records stored in cloud systems

32. Peter did not inform me or Jax of the card cancellations in advance. We only discovered them when payments began failing and services were suspended.

33. The timing of the card cancellations (one day after I provided comprehensive reports) demonstrates Peter's strategic intent to create operational chaos and then complain about lack of documentation.

---

### 3.3 June 10, 2025: Fraud Report to Bantjes

34. On June 10, 2025, I reported serious fraud and theft concerns to the trustee, Daniel Jacobus Bantjes.

35. I reported:
   - Evidence of revenue hijacking and theft
   - Kayla's murder in 2023 (previously unreported to authorities)
   - Peter's alleged involvement in financial irregularities
   - R1.8 million debt to Rezonance trust
   - Request for urgent forensic audit

36. Bantjes' response was dismissive: **"I am going away for 2 weeks."** He refused to investigate the serious allegations I reported.

37. Bantjes subsequently supported Peter's interdict application, demonstrating a conflict of interest and breach of his fiduciary duty as trustee.

---

## SECTION 4: EVENTS FOLLOWING THE EXCHANGE

### 4.1 June-July 2025: System Restrictions

38. During June and July 2025, Peter progressively restricted my access to business systems, including:
   - Banking systems
   - Accounting software
   - Email systems
   - Cloud storage
   - E-commerce platforms

39. These restrictions prevented me from retrieving historical records and documentation that Peter was simultaneously demanding.

40. Peter created a documentation gap through his own actions (card cancellations and system restrictions), then complained about lack of documentation.

---

### 4.2 August 13, 2025: Ex Parte Interdict Application

41. On August 13, 2025, Peter filed an ex parte application for an interdict, claiming:
   - "Recently discovered" financial irregularities
   - Urgent action needed to prevent ongoing harm
   - Lack of documentation and transparency
   - Unauthorized IT expenses and director loan withdrawals

42. Peter's allegations contradicted his own **"Has anything changed?"** question, which demonstrated he knew nothing had changed.

43. Peter waited 68 days between his alleged "discovery" of irregularities and filing the interdict, contradicting his claims of urgency.

44. The timing of Peter's interdict was strategic:
   - Filed 8 days after a settlement agreement (August 5, 2025)
   - Coordinated with investment payout timeline (9-month window)
   - Designed to create leverage in settlement negotiations

---

### 4.3 August 19, 2025: Interdict Granted

45. On August 19, 2025, the Court granted Peter's interdict ex parte, without hearing from me or Jax.

46. The interdict blocked all system access, completing the obstruction that Peter began in June with card cancellations and system restrictions.

47. The interdict caused catastrophic harm:
   - R18M+ financial losses
   - R50M+ regulatory exposure (Jax's Responsible Person duties blocked)
   - Business operations destroyed
   - Vendor and customer relationships damaged
   - Criminal liability exposure for Jax (37 jurisdictions)

48. Peter failed to disclose to the Court:
   - Jax's Responsible Person role (37 jurisdictions)
   - The disproportionate harm the interdict would cause
   - His own conduct creating the problems he complained about
   - His existing powers as trustee to address concerns
   - The **"Has anything changed?"** exchange demonstrating his knowledge

---

## SECTION 5: PETER'S PATTERN OF BAD FAITH

### 5.1 Knowledge vs. Claims

49. Peter had full knowledge of all business arrangements for years:
   - Financial statements showed IT expenses annually
   - Peter participated in director loan account practices himself
   - Peter had access to all financial information through Bantjes
   - Peter's **"Has anything changed?"** question demonstrated his knowledge

50. Yet Peter claimed in his founding affidavit:
   - "Recently discovered" financial irregularities
   - Urgent action needed to address new concerns
   - Lack of transparency and documentation
   - Unauthorized expenses and withdrawals

51. Peter's claims are contradicted by his own conduct and the **"Has anything changed?"** exchange.

---

### 5.2 Creating Problems, Then Complaining

52. Peter created the problems he complained about:

   **a) Documentation Gap:**
   - Peter cancelled cards → Service suspensions → Loss of access to documentation
   - Peter restricted system access → Cannot retrieve records
   - Peter then complained about lack of documentation

   **b) Operational Chaos:**
   - Peter's card cancellations caused payment failures
   - Peter's system restrictions prevented normal operations
   - Peter then complained about business disruption

   **c) Communication Breakdown:**
   - Peter refused to respond to emails
   - Peter avoided meetings and discussions
   - Peter then complained about lack of cooperation

53. Peter's pattern demonstrates deliberate creation of problems to manufacture justification for the interdict.

---

### 5.3 Strategic Timing

54. Peter's timing demonstrates strategic calculation, not reactive urgency:

   **Timeline:**
   - June 6: I provide comprehensive reports to Bantjes
   - June 7: Peter cancels cards (one day later)
   - June 10: I report fraud concerns to Bantjes
   - June-July: Peter restricts system access
   - August 5: Settlement agreement signed
   - August 13: Peter files interdict (8 days after settlement, 68 days after alleged "discovery")
   - August 19: Interdict granted

55. The timing demonstrates:
   - Peter waited for strategic moment (after settlement)
   - Peter created problems (card cancellations, system restrictions)
   - Peter manufactured justification (documentation gap, operational chaos)
   - Peter used interdict for leverage (settlement negotiations)

---

## SECTION 6: IMPACT OF PETER'S CONDUCT

### 6.1 Personal Impact

56. Peter's conduct has caused me severe personal harm:
   - Loss of livelihood (cannot work due to interdict)
   - Reputational damage (allegations of financial misconduct)
   - Emotional distress (family conflict and legal proceedings)
   - Financial losses (legal costs, lost income)

57. The **"Has anything changed?"** exchange was particularly distressing because it demonstrated Peter's bad faith. He knew nothing had changed, yet proceeded to destroy the business and my livelihood based on manufactured allegations.

---

### 6.2 Impact on Jax

58. Peter's conduct has caused severe harm to my mother, Jax:
   - Criminal liability exposure (R50M+ as Responsible Person)
   - Regulatory crisis (37 jurisdictions)
   - Business destruction (R18M+ financial losses)
   - Reputational damage
   - Emotional distress

59. Peter failed to disclose Jax's Responsible Person role to the Court in his ex parte application. If the Court had known about Jax's legal obligations and the catastrophic harm the interdict would cause, the interdict would not have been granted.

---

### 6.3 Impact on Business

60. Peter's conduct has destroyed the business that took years to build:
   - Revenue growth from R2.1M (2022) to R19.1M (2024) - 809% increase
   - International expansion to 37 jurisdictions
   - Vendor and customer relationships built over years
   - IT infrastructure investment enabling operations

61. The business was profitable and compliant before Peter's interference. Peter's conduct has caused the business disruption he now cites as justification for the interdict.

---

## SECTION 7: CONCLUSION

### 7.1 Summary of Key Points

62. The **"Has anything changed?"** exchange is critical evidence demonstrating:
   - Peter's knowledge that nothing had changed
   - Peter's manufactured urgency and false allegations
   - Peter's bad faith throughout
   - Peter's strategic timing and leverage motive

63. Peter's conduct demonstrates a pattern of:
   - Creating problems, then complaining about them
   - Manufacturing justification for the interdict
   - Strategic timing for leverage in settlement negotiations
   - Material non-disclosure to the Court

64. Peter's allegations are contradicted by:
   - His own **"Has anything changed?"** question

   - His 68-day delay before filing interdict

---

### 7.2 Relief Sought

   - The interdict should be set aside (based on Peter's bad faith and material non-disclosure)
   - Peter's allegations are false and manufactured
   - Peter created the problems he complains about
   - The **"Has anything changed?"** exchange demonstrates Peter's knowledge and bad faith

66. I am available to give oral evidence and to be cross-examined on this statement if required by the Court.
