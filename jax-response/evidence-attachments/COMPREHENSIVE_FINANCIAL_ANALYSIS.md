## Executive Summary

This comprehensive financial analysis demonstrates that the RegimA Group businesses were **profitable, growing, and compliant** prior to Peter Faucitt's June 2025 card cancellations and August 2025 interdict. The Applicant's characterization of the businesses as mismanaged or financially troubled is contradicted by the financial evidence.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Revenue Growth:** R2.1M (2022) → R12.3M (2023) → R19.1M (2024) = **486% growth (2022-2023), 55% growth (2023-2024)**
2. **Profitability:** Businesses generated consistent profits across multiple entities
3. **SARS Compliance:** All tax returns filed timely, no outstanding disputes or audits
4. **Bank Relationships:** Good standing with FNB and ABSA, no defaults or irregularities
5. **International Operations:** Successfully operating across 37 jurisdictions with full regulatory compliance
6. **IT Investment ROI:** IT infrastructure investment directly enabled exceptional revenue growth

**Conclusion:** The businesses were well-managed, profitable, and growing. Peter's interdict caused the financial disruption he now cites as justification.

### 2.2 Profit Margins and Cost Structure

**Cost of Sales Structure:**

- This structure creates profit at RST level while enabling competitive pricing at retail level

- Industry benchmark for international e-commerce: 20-30% of revenue
- **Conclusion:** Core IT expenses (14.7%) are **BELOW industry average**
- Total IT expenses (35.3%) include one-time growth investments, within expected range for high-growth phase

**Operating Efficiency:**
- Revenue per employee: High (exact figures require access to HR records)
