**Case No:** 2025-137857  
**In the High Court of South Africa (Western Cape Division, Cape Town)**

## ANALYSIS: ESTABLISHED PRACTICE OF INFORMAL DIRECTOR LOAN TRANSACTIONS

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 This analysis addresses the Applicant's allegations regarding a R500,000 payment to Daniel Faucitt on 16 July 2025, which the Applicant characterizes as "unauthorized."

1.2 This characterization is factually incorrect and fundamentally inconsistent with established business practices that the Applicant himself accepted and utilized for decades.

1.3 This analysis demonstrates:
   - The historical practice of informal director loan account transactions
   - The Applicant's active participation in and benefit from this practice
   - The inconsistency of the Applicant's current objection with his historical conduct
   - The timing and context revealing this allegation is pretextual

## 2. ESTABLISHED PRACTICE OF INFORMAL DIRECTOR LOAN TRANSACTIONS

### 2.1 Historical Collaborative Business Model

2.1.1 For the entire history of the RegimA businesses (spanning multiple decades), the companies operated under an informal, trust-based, collaborative business model.

2.1.2 Under this model, director loan account transactions were processed informally without formal board resolutions:
   - Directors routinely drew funds from their respective director loan accounts
   - No formal board resolutions were required for such transactions
   - Transactions were processed based on bank references and signatory authority
   - All payments were clearly marked on bank statements
   - Payments were automatically allocated to corresponding director loan accounts
   - Director loan accounts were reconciled during regular accounting processes in Sage

2.1.3 This informal practice was:
   - **Transparent**: All transactions appeared on bank statements and in Sage accounting records
   - **Consistent**: Applied uniformly to all directors over decades
   - **Accepted**: No director raised concerns about this practice during its decades-long operation
   - **Documented**: Financial records maintained proper allocation to director loan accounts

### 2.2 Directors Maintained Substantial Loan Account Balances

2.2.1 Directors maintained director loan account balances over the years, with credit balances often reaching several million rand.

2.2.2 The existence of these substantial credit balances demonstrates:
   - The legitimacy of the director loan account structure
   - The companies' obligation to directors for funds advanced or left in the business
   - The routine nature of transactions against these accounts

## 3. THE APPLICANT'S PARTICIPATION IN THE INFORMAL MODEL

### 3.1 Peter Faucitt's Historical Conduct

3.1.1 **Critical fact**: The Applicant himself actively participated in this informal director loan model for decades without objection.

3.1.2 The Applicant's participation included:
   - Making similar withdrawals from his director loan account on numerous occasions
   - Never requesting formal board resolutions for his own transactions
   - Never questioning the legitimacy of the informal practice when he benefited from it
   - Never characterizing such transactions as "unauthorized" or improper
   - Never raising concerns about the absence of board resolutions for director loan transactions

3.1.3 The Applicant accepted the trust-based nature of the business relationships and participated in collaborative decision-making without formal documentation.

### 3.2 Evidence of the Applicant's Own Withdrawals

3.2.1 The Applicant made multiple withdrawals from his director loan account under the identical informal system he now condemns:
   - **[To be evidenced via Annexures JF-PA1 through JF-PA4]**
   - Bank statements showing the Applicant's withdrawals without board resolutions
   - Director loan account statements demonstrating decades of participation

3.2.2 The Applicant never questioned this practice when it served his interests.

## 4. THE APPLICANT'S SUDDEN AND INCONSISTENT OBJECTION

### 4.1 Fundamental Inconsistency

4.1.1 The Applicant's current objection to the R500,000 payment is fundamentally inconsistent with his decades-long participation in the same practice.

4.1.2 **Comparative Analysis**:

| Aspect | When Applicant Benefited | Now (R500K to Daniel) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Practice** | Informal director loans without board resolutions | Same practice |
| **Applicant's Position** | Accepted without objection | Claims "unauthorized" |
| **Legitimacy** | Never questioned | Suddenly characterized as misconduct |
| **Timing** | Decades of acceptance | Objection raised strategically |
| **Documentation** | No board resolutions required | Demands board resolutions |
| **Standards Applied** | Informal practice acceptable | Same practice now "improper" |

### 4.2 Timing Demonstrates Pretextual Nature

4.2.1 The timing of the Applicant's sudden objection reveals this is pretextual rather than a genuine concern about governance:
   - **16 July 2025**: R500,000 payment made (routine director loan transaction)
   - **~5 August 2025**: Applicant consults attorneys (approximately 20 days later)
   - **14 August 2025**: Applicant files interdict application (28 days after payment)

4.2.2 The Applicant provides no explanation for why this particular transaction warranted objection when identical practices were acceptable for decades.

4.2.3 The objection coincides with:
   - Settlement negotiations between parties
   - Control disputes regarding the businesses
   - Strategic positioning for litigation advantage

### 4.3 Application of Inconsistent Standards

4.3.1 The Applicant applies fundamentally different standards to identical conduct:
   - When he benefited: informal practice was acceptable and proper
   - When others use the same practice: suddenly "unauthorized" and improper
   - Same signatory authority, same accounting treatment, same long-established practice
   - Different characterization based solely on which party benefits

4.3.2 This inconsistency demonstrates the allegation is pretextual and designed for strategic litigation advantage rather than based on genuine governance concerns.

## 5. LEGITIMATE AUTHORIZATION FOR THE PAYMENT

### 5.1 Proper Signatory Authority

5.1.1 The R500,000 payment was made by Jacqueline Faucitt, who held legitimate signatory authority as director of RWD (RegimA Worldwide Distribution).

5.1.2 Directors have authority to make business payments within the scope of their duties, including transactions against director loan accounts that have been part of established practice for decades.

### 5.2 Consistency with Established Practice

5.2.1 The payment was made in accordance with the exact same informal process that had been followed for decades by all directors, including the Applicant.

5.2.2 The payment was:
   - Properly allocated to Daniel Faucitt's director loan account
   - Recorded in the company's accounting system (Sage)
   - Reflected on bank statements
   - Processed through established banking procedures

5.2.3 This transaction was no different from countless similar transactions over the decades, including those benefiting the Applicant himself.

---

## 6. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE APPLICANT'S CREDIBILITY

### 6.1 Demonstrates Material Non-Disclosure and Inconsistent Conduct

6.1.1 The Applicant's conduct demonstrates material non-disclosure and inconsistent application of standards:
   - Participated in informal model when it benefited him
   - Now applies the same practice inconsistently against others
   - Applies different standards to his own conduct versus others' conduct
   - Raises objections strategically timed with litigation, not when transaction occurred

### 6.2 Undermines Basis for Ex Parte Relief

6.2.1 Ex parte relief requires utmost good faith and full disclosure of material facts.

6.2.2 The Applicant's failure to disclose his own participation in the identical informal practice he now condemns constitutes material non-disclosure.

6.2.3 Had the court been informed that:
   - The practice was decades-long and established
   - The Applicant himself participated in and benefited from the identical practice
   - The Applicant never objected to this practice when it served his interests
   - The Applicant made similar withdrawals without board resolutions

   The court would likely have viewed the "unauthorized payment" allegation differently.

### 6.3 Pattern of Inconsistent Positions

6.3.1 This inconsistent objection is part of a broader pattern where the Applicant:
   - Accepts practices and benefits from them for years
   - Suddenly objects to the same practices at a strategically convenient time
   - Characterizes long-established norms as "misconduct" in current proceedings
   - Applies one standard to himself and a different standard to others

## 7. CONCLUSION

### 7.1 Summary of Key Findings

7.1.1 The R500,000 payment was made in accordance with decades-long established practice of informal director loan account transactions.

7.1.2 The Applicant himself actively participated in and benefited from this identical practice for decades without objection.

7.1.3 The Applicant's sudden objection to this established practice is fundamentally inconsistent with his historical conduct and reveals the pretextual nature of this allegation.

7.1.4 The Applicant's inconsistent application of standards - accepting the practice when he benefits, condemning it when others use it - demonstrates material non-disclosure and undermines his credibility.

### 7.2 Legal Implications

7.2.1 The Applicant cannot credibly claim a practice was "unauthorized" when he himself utilized the identical practice for decades.

7.2.2 The material non-disclosure of these facts in the ex parte application undermines the basis for the granted interdict.

7.2.3 The timing and context of the objection - 20 days after the payment and coinciding with litigation proceedings - raise questions about the basis for the objection given decades of prior acceptance.
