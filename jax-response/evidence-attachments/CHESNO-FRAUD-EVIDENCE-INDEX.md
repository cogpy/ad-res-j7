1. **Legitimate Crisis:** £500,000+ fraud created genuine insolvency risk
2. **Necessary Intervention:** Professional assessment supported Daniel's appointment
3. **Successful Recovery:** Eight-year restoration demonstrates competence
4. **Peter's Errors:** Factual mischaracterizations damage credibility

This evidence framework transforms Peter's attempt to characterize Daniel's appointment as "arising from wrongdoing" into a demonstration of Peter's willingness to misrepresent facts to support his narrative, while simultaneously establishing Daniel's competence and integrity through objective professional validation.
