## Settlement Agreement - Final Version (Signed 11 August 2025)
### Between Peter Faucitt and Jacqueline Faucitt & Daniel Faucitt

**Date:** 11 August 2025  
**Matter:** Family Dispute Resolution - Case 2025-137857  
**Context:** Same-day mediation and signing, all discussions "off-the-record"

---

### CLAUSE 2: MEDICAL ASSESSMENTS AND TREATMENTS

#### 2.1 Initial Assessments
[Note: Full text of 2.1 refers to initial psychiatric evaluations and drug screening]

#### 2.2 Ongoing Treatments Clause
**"The parties agree to undergo any further tests/assessments and/or treatments that may be directed by the psychiatric professional."**

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**
- Open-ended obligation to "any further" tests/assessments/treatments
- Singular "psychiatric professional" - who selects this professional?
- No limitation on scope, duration, or cost
- Binding "directed by" language creates mandatory compliance

#### 2.3 Professional Selection by Attorneys
**"The service providers and/or medical professionals to conduct the tests set out in clause 2.1 above will be jointly agreed to by the parties' attorneys."**

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**
- Changes from "psychiatric professional" (2.2) to "service providers and/or medical professionals"
- Inconsistent terminology creates confusion
- Only refers to "tests set out in clause 2.1" - what about 2.2 treatments?
- Control given to "parties' attorneys" not parties themselves
- "Jointly agreed" by attorneys - removes party involvement

#### 2.4 Gauteng Family Law Forum Fallback
**"By failure of such agreement, the attorneys' for the parties shall request the appointment of such expert by the Gauteng Family Law Forum, and shall be bound to the appointment made in terms thereof."**

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**
- Fallback mechanism only if attorneys can't agree
- Still removes parties from decision-making
- Only applies to "expert" - singular, unclear if covers all "service providers"

#### 2.5 Reports to Attorneys
**"The reports prepared by the medical professionals will be provided to the parties' attorneys."**

**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**
- Reports go to attorneys, not parties
- "Medical professionals" - another term shift
- No guarantee parties receive reports directly

#### 2.6 Cost Clause (ADDED IN LAST 5 MINUTES BEFORE SIGNING)
**"The costs of these medical assessments shall be borne by each party individually."**

**CRITICAL FRAUD EVIDENCE:**
- ⚠️ **ADDED DURING FINAL 5 MINUTES** between reading and signing
- Rushed addition without proper review
- "These medical assessments" - vague scope
- No cost limitation or cap
- First mention of individual cost responsibility
---

### CLAUSE 3: COSTS (ADDED IN LAST 5 MINUTES - DUPLICATES 2.6)

#### 3.1 Duplicate Cost Provision
**"Save for the costs referred to in paragraph 2.6 above, each party will bear their own costs."**

**CRITICAL FRAUD EVIDENCE:**
- ⚠️ **ENTIRE SECTION 3 ADDED IN LAST 5 MINUTES** before signing
- **DUPLICATES** the cost clause already stated in 2.6
- Creates confusion: "Save for costs referred to in 2.6" then states same thing
- Evidence of rushed, incoherent drafting
- No opportunity for proper review

---

## CRITICAL FRAUD AND INCOHERENCE ANALYSIS

### Terminology Inconsistencies (Evidence of Rushed Drafting)
1. **Clause 2.2:** "psychiatric professional" (singular)
2. **Clause 2.3:** "service providers and/or medical professionals" (plural, different terms)
3. **Clause 2.4:** "expert" (singular)
4. **Clause 2.5:** "medical professionals" (plural, different from 2.3)
5. **Clause 2.6:** "medical assessments" (no mention of professionals)

**ANALYSIS:** The shifting terminology demonstrates:
- Rushed, incoherent drafting
- No clear definition of who provides what services
- Confusion between assessments, tests, treatments
- Unclear scope and authority

### Duplicate Cost Clauses (Evidence of Last-Minute Changes)
- **Clause 2.6:** "The costs of these medical assessments shall be borne by each party individually"
- **Clause 3.1:** "Save for the costs referred to in paragraph 2.6 above, each party will bear their own costs"

**ANALYSIS:**
- Section 3 completely unnecessary - repeats 2.6
- "Save for" construction creates circular logic
- Evidence both sections added hastily in final 5 minutes
- No time for proper legal review or coherence check

### Missing Procedures and Protections
**Problems identified:**
1. Clause 2.2 mentions "psychiatric professional" - no selection procedure for ongoing treatments
2. Clause 2.3 only covers "tests set out in clause 2.1" - what about 2.2 treatments?
3. No procedure for selecting "service providers" for ongoing treatments
4. No cost caps despite individual payment requirement
5. No definition of what constitutes "tests/assessments" vs "treatments"

### Off-the-Record Mediation Context
**Per mediation agreement:**
- All discussions during mediation were "off-the-record"
- Parties instructed: no draft copies admissible as evidence
- Parties instructed: no discussions admissible in any case
- Creates evidentiary challenge for proving what was originally discussed

### Same-Day Rush Timeline
**11 August 2025 - Critical Timeline:**
- Morning/Day: Off-the-record mediation discussions
- Late Afternoon: Agreement drafted
- Final 5 Minutes: Clauses 2.6 and 3 added
- Immediate Signing: No time for review of final changes
- Daniel's Question: "Has anything changed?"
- Response: Presumably minimal or no disclosure of additions

## LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

### Evidentiary Challenges Created by Mediation Agreement
**Problem:** Mediation agreement states all discussions "off-the-record" and not admissible
**Impact:**
- Cannot use mediation discussions to prove what was originally agreed
- Cannot use draft copies to show what changed
- Reliance on final signed document only
- Makes proving fraud more difficult

### What CAN Be Used as Evidence
1. **Final signed agreement itself** - showing incoherent drafting
2. **Duplicate cost clauses** - proving rushed last-minute changes
3. **Terminology inconsistencies** - demonstrating lack of proper review
4. **Daniel's question about changes** - if this occurred AFTER mediation concluded
5. **Timeline of signing** - same day as mediation, no cooling-off period

### Fraud in the Inducement - Limited Evidence Base
**Challenge:** Without admissible drafts or mediation discussions, must rely on:
- Incoherent drafting as evidence of rushed changes
- Duplicate clauses as proof of last-minute additions
- Terminology shifts as evidence of multiple hasty edits
- Same-day timeline as evidence of insufficient review time
- Questions asked at signing about whether anything changed

### Unconscionability Arguments (Stronger Than Fraud)
Given evidentiary limitations, focus on:
1. **Incoherent Terms:** Agreement is internally contradictory
2. **Rushed Process:** Same-day mediation and signing
3. **No Review Period:** Clauses added in final 5 minutes
4. **Unlimited Scope:** Open-ended treatments with no caps
5. **Cost Exposure:** No limits on financial obligations
6. **Loss of Control:** Attorneys control all aspects

- **Admissible:** Timeline of same-day mediation and signing
- **Admissible:** Testimony about last-minute additions (if after mediation)
