Every critical control mechanism was altered between the draft and final versions, transferring complete authority from the parties to their attorneys while eliminating all safeguards and limitations.

## WEAPONIZATION FRAMEWORK ANALYSIS

### Control Mechanism Creation
1. **Attorney Selection Power:** Unilateral professional selection authority
2. **Binding Treatment Authority:** Mandatory compliance with attorney-selected professionals
3. **Financial Control:** Unlimited cost determination by attorneys
4. **Enforcement Power:** Legal mechanisms to compel compliance

### Pattern Consistency with Historical Behavior
- **Medical Testing as Control Tool:** Creates framework for weaponizing psychiatric evaluations
- **Open-Ended "Treatments":** Enables indefinite control through ongoing interventions
- **Professional Opinion Weaponization:** Allows selection of professionals to find "issues"
- **Disagreement = Mental Health Problem:** Framework to characterize resistance as psychiatric issue

---

## TIMELINE EVIDENCE INTEGRATION

### Fraud Timeline Coordination
- **11 August 2025:** JF5 settlement signed under misrepresentation
- **13 August 2025:** Peter files interdict (2 days later)
- **Pattern Demonstrated:** Settlement manipulation → immediate legal action

### Strategic Coordination Evidence
1. **Pre-planned Legal Strategy:** Interdict prepared while settlement being manipulated
2. **Control Mechanism Establishment:** Settlement creates framework for ongoing control
3. **Timing Coordination:** 48-hour window between fraud and legal action
4. **Pattern Consistency:** Settlement fraud supports broader manipulation pattern
