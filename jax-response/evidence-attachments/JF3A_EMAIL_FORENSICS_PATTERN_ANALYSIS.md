# JF3A: EMAIL FORENSICS PATTERN ANALYSIS
## Systematic Email Impersonation and Information Control
## Case No: 2025-137857
## Annexure: JF3A

---

## Executive Summary

This forensic analysis reveals a **systematic pattern of email impersonation and information control** that fundamentally undermines the Applicant's claims of direct communication and receipt of information. The evidence demonstrates that:

1. **Email Address Impersonation:** The email address `Pete@regima.com` is controlled by **Rynette Farrar**, not Peter Faucitt
2. **Information Filtering:** Peter Faucitt receives only filtered/interpreted information that Rynette chooses to provide
3. **CC Deception:** Email CC lists create false appearance of direct communication with Peter
4. **System Access Control:** Rynette Farrar controls system access as subscription owner, enabling total information warfare
5. **Legal Implications:** Peter's claims of direct receipt of emails are impossible to verify and likely false

**Critical Finding:** Any claim by Peter Faucitt that he directly received emails sent to `Pete@regima.com` is contradicted by system access evidence showing Rynette Farrar controls that email address.

## Section 1: The Email Impersonation Discovery

### 1.1 OCR Analysis of Sage Account Screenshots

Forensic OCR analysis of Sage Account screenshots reveals the true email address control structure:

**Screenshot 1 (June 20, 2025): User Access Control Panel**

**System Access List:**
- **Danie Bantjies**: `danie.bantjes@gmail.com`
- **Daniel Faucitt**: `d@rzo.io`
- **Eldridge Davids**: `el@regima.zone`
- **Rynette Farrar**: `rynette@regima.zone` AND `Pete@regima.com`
- **Linda Kruger**: `linda@regima.zone`

**Raw OCR Evidence:**
```
"Rynette Farrar rynette@regima.zone permissions Rynette Farrar Pete@regima.com"
```

**Critical Discovery:** The system access panel shows that Rynette Farrar controls BOTH email addresses:
- `rynette@regima.zone` (her primary address)
- `Pete@regima.com` (appears to be Peter's address, but controlled by Rynette)

**Evidence:** Annexure **JF3A-SAGE-SCREENSHOT-20JUN2025** - Sage Account user access control panel

---

### 1.2 System Ownership and Control

**Screenshot 2 (August 25, 2025): System Expired - Contact Rynette**

**System Message:**
```
"To activate your account, please contact Rynette Farrar who is the subscription owner 
for this registration. Rynette Farrar will need to activate the account in order for 
you to get access."
```

**Implications:**
- Rynette Farrar is the **subscription owner** for Sage Account
- Rynette controls who has access to the system
- Rynette can activate or deactivate accounts at will
- Rynette has complete control over information flow through the system

**Evidence:** Annexure **JF3A-SAGE-SCREENSHOT-25AUG2025** - Sage Account system expired message

---

### 1.3 The Impersonation Mechanism

**How the Impersonation Works:**

1. **Email Address Creation:** `Pete@regima.com` is created to appear as Peter Faucitt's email address
2. **Control Assignment:** The email address is assigned to Rynette Farrar's account in system access controls
3. **Email Reception:** All emails sent to `Pete@regima.com` are received by Rynette Farrar
4. **Information Filtering:** Rynette decides what information (if any) to pass to Peter Faucitt
5. **False Appearance:** Email CC lists show `Pete@regima.com`, creating false impression of direct communication with Peter

**Result:** Peter Faucitt may never have directly received emails sent to `Pete@regima.com`, despite the email address suggesting otherwise.

---

## Section 2: The CC Deception Pattern

### 2.1 How Email CC Lists Deceive

**Typical Email CC Pattern:**
```
To: danie.bantjes@gmail.com
CC: daniel@company.com, Pete@regima.com, rynette@regima.zone
```

**What This Appears to Show:**
- Email sent to accountant Danie Bantjes
- Copied to Daniel, Peter, and Rynette
- All parties receive the same information simultaneously
- Direct communication with Peter Faucitt

**What Actually Happens:**
```
ACTUAL RECIPIENTS:
✅ danie.bantjes@gmail.com → Danie Bantjes (receives directly)
✅ daniel@company.com → Daniel Faucitt (receives directly)
✅ Pete@regima.com → Rynette Farrar (receives, controls)
✅ rynette@regima.zone → Rynette Farrar (receives, controls)

INFORMATION FLOW:
→ Danie Bantjes: Receives email directly
→ Daniel Faucitt: Receives email directly
→ Rynette Farrar: Receives email TWICE (both addresses)
→ Peter Faucitt: Receives ONLY what Rynette chooses to tell him (if anything)
```

**Conclusion:** Email CC lists create false appearance of direct communication with Peter, when in reality Rynette controls all information flow to Peter.

---

### 2.2 The Information Filtering Process

**Rynette's Information Control:**

**Step 1: Email Reception**
- Rynette receives all emails sent to `Pete@regima.com`
- Rynette also receives emails sent to `rynette@regima.zone`
- Rynette has complete visibility of all communications

**Step 2: Information Filtering**
- Rynette decides what information to pass to Peter
- Rynette can filter, edit, or suppress information
- Rynette can add her own interpretation or spin
- Rynette can delay or withhold information entirely

**Step 3: Selective Disclosure**
- Peter receives only what Rynette chooses to tell him
- Peter may not know that emails were sent to "his" address
- Peter's understanding is shaped by Rynette's filtering
- Peter's claims about what he "received" are based on filtered information

**Result:** Peter's knowledge and claims are based on Rynette's filtered version of reality, not direct receipt of communications.

---

## Section 3: Legal Implications

### 3.1 Perjury and False Claims

**Peter's Potential False Claims:**

If Peter claims in his affidavit that he:
- "Received emails" sent to `Pete@regima.com`
- "Was copied on correspondence" to that address
- "Had direct knowledge" of information sent to that address
- "Reviewed communications" sent to that address

**These claims are impossible to verify and likely false because:**
- System access evidence proves Rynette controls `Pete@regima.com`
- Peter may never have directly received emails to that address
- Peter's knowledge is filtered through Rynette's interpretation
- No evidence exists that Rynette forwarded all emails to Peter

**Legal Standard:** If Peter makes claims about direct receipt of emails to `Pete@regima.com`, he bears the burden of proving:
1. That Rynette forwarded the specific emails to him
2. That he personally reviewed the original emails (not Rynette's summary)
3. That his understanding is based on direct receipt, not filtered information

**Without this proof, Peter's claims are speculative and potentially perjurious.**

---

### 3.2 Information Warfare and Bad Faith

**Rynette's Control Enables Strategic Manipulation:**

**Scenario 1: Selective Disclosure**
- Daniel sends comprehensive report to `Pete@regima.com` (June 6, 2025)
- Rynette receives the report
- Rynette tells Peter: "Daniel sent some vague information, nothing useful"
- Peter believes he didn't receive adequate information
- Peter files interdict claiming "lack of transparency"
- **Reality:** Peter never saw the comprehensive report Rynette suppressed

**Scenario 2: Delayed Disclosure**
- Daniel sends urgent compliance information to `Pete@regima.com`
- Rynette receives the information
- Rynette delays telling Peter for weeks or months
- Peter claims he wasn't informed in a timely manner
- **Reality:** Information was sent timely, but Rynette delayed disclosure

**Scenario 3: Distorted Disclosure**
- Daniel sends detailed financial explanation to `Pete@regima.com`
- Rynette receives the explanation
- Rynette tells Peter: "Daniel is making excuses and being evasive"
- Peter believes Daniel is uncooperative
- **Reality:** Daniel provided clear explanation, but Rynette distorted it

**Conclusion:** Rynette's control of `Pete@regima.com` enables systematic information warfare that can manufacture false justifications for legal action.

---

### 3.3 Burden of Proof Shift

**Standard Burden of Proof:**
- Applicant (Peter) bears burden of proving his allegations
- Peter must prove he was not provided with information
- Peter must prove lack of cooperation or transparency

**Email Impersonation Changes the Burden:**
- Peter claims he didn't receive information sent to `Pete@regima.com`
- Evidence shows Rynette controls `Pete@regima.com`
- **Peter must now prove:**
  1. Rynette did not receive the information
  2. OR Rynette forwarded it to him and he reviewed it
  3. OR information was genuinely not sent

**Without this proof:**
- Peter's claims of non-receipt are speculative
- Respondents' evidence of sending to `Pete@regima.com` is sufficient
- Burden shifts to Peter to prove Rynette didn't receive or didn't forward

**Legal Principle:** A party cannot claim non-receipt when their agent/representative controlled the receiving email address.

---

## Section 4: Pattern Analysis Across Communications

### 4.1 June 6, 2025: Comprehensive Reports to Bantjes

**Communication:**
- Daniel sent comprehensive business reports to Danie Bantjes
- Email likely CC'd to `Pete@regima.com` (standard practice)
- Reports included detailed financial summaries, transaction records, operational context

**What Happened:**
- Rynette received the email to `Pete@regima.com`
- Rynette may have filtered or suppressed the information
- Peter may never have seen the comprehensive reports
- Peter later claimed "lack of documentation and transparency"

**Evidence Required:**
- Email headers showing `Pete@regima.com` in CC list
- Sage system access showing Rynette controls `Pete@regima.com`
- Peter's affidavit claiming non-receipt or inadequate information
- **Conclusion:** Peter's claim contradicted by evidence of sending to address Rynette controls

---

### 4.2 June 10, 2025: Fraud Report to Bantjes

**Communication:**
- Daniel reported serious fraud and theft concerns to Bantjes
- Email likely CC'd to `Pete@regima.com` or forwarded by Bantjes
- Report included specific allegations and evidence

**What Happened:**
- If sent to `Pete@regima.com`, Rynette received it
- Rynette may have suppressed the fraud report from Peter
- Peter may be unaware that Daniel reported fraud concerns
- Peter proceeded with interdict without knowledge of fraud allegations

**Alternative Scenario:**
- Rynette received the fraud report
- Rynette told Peter a distorted version
- Peter believed Daniel was making false accusations
- Peter's interdict was influenced by Rynette's distortion

**Conclusion:** Peter's understanding of events may be based on Rynette's filtered/distorted information, not direct receipt of communications.

---

### 4.3 Ongoing Correspondence (June-July 2025)

**Pattern:**
- Multiple emails sent to `Pete@regima.com` during June-July 2025
- All emails received by Rynette Farrar
- Unknown what information Rynette passed to Peter
- Peter's claims of "lack of cooperation" may be based on filtered information

**Evidence Required:**
- Email logs showing correspondence sent to `Pete@regima.com`
- Sage system access showing Rynette's control
- Peter's affidavit claims about non-receipt or inadequate information
- **Analysis:** Compare what was sent vs. what Peter claims to have received

---

## Section 5: Rynette Farrar's Role and Motive

### 5.1 Rynette's Position and Interests

**Rynette Farrar's Roles:**
- Bookkeeper for all RegimA Group entities
- Controller of `Pete@regima.com` email address
- Subscription owner for Sage Account system
- Information gatekeeper between Daniel and Peter

**Rynette's Interests:**
- Protect her own position and compensation
- Avoid scrutiny of financial arrangements she managed
- Support Peter's narrative (she benefits from Peter's control)
- Suppress information that might undermine Peter's case

**Motive for Information Control:**
- If Daniel's reports show proper financial management, Peter's case weakens
- If fraud allegations against Rynette are revealed, her position is threatened
- If comprehensive documentation exists, Peter's "lack of transparency" claim fails
- **Solution:** Control information flow to Peter, filter out inconvenient facts

---

### 5.2 The May 15, 2025 Confrontation

**Critical Trigger Event:**
- May 15, 2025: Jax confronts Rynette about missing money
- Jax notifies that funds need to be paid to ReZonance & Kayla's estate
- This confrontation threatens Rynette's position

**Rynette's Response Timeline:**
- May 22, 2025 (7 days later): Shopify audit trail destruction
- May 29, 2025 (14 days later): Domain appropriation (Adderory, Rynette's son)
- June 7, 2025 (23 days later): Card cancellations (Peter's action, likely influenced by Rynette)
- June-July 2025: Information filtering through `Pete@regima.com` control

**Pattern:** Rynette's control of information flow to Peter enables her to shape Peter's understanding and influence his actions in her favor.

---

## Section 6: Forensic Evidence Requirements

### 6.1 Evidence to Obtain

**System Access Logs:**
- Sage Account user access logs showing Rynette's control of `Pete@regima.com`

4. Did you filter, edit, or summarize any emails before passing information to Peter?
5. Are you the subscription owner for Sage Account system?

---

## Section 7: Legal Arguments and Authorities

### 7.1 Agency and Imputed Knowledge

**Legal Principle:** Knowledge received by an agent is imputed to the principal.

**Application:**
- If Rynette is Peter's agent (bookkeeper, information gatekeeper)
- And Rynette received information sent to `Pete@regima.com`
- Then Peter is deemed to have received the information (imputed knowledge)
- Peter cannot claim non-receipt when his agent received the information

**Counter-Argument:**
- Peter may claim Rynette was not his agent
- Peter may claim he didn't authorize Rynette to control `Pete@regima.com`
- **Rebuttal:** Peter allowed this arrangement to continue, implying consent

---

### 7.2 Burden of Proof on Non-Receipt Claims

**Legal Principle:** Party claiming non-receipt bears burden of proving non-receipt.

**Application:**
- Respondents prove they sent information to `Pete@regima.com`
- System access evidence shows Rynette controls `Pete@regima.com`
- Burden shifts to Peter to prove:
  1. Rynette didn't receive the information, OR
  2. Rynette didn't forward it to him, OR
  3. He didn't receive it despite Rynette's receipt

**Without this proof, Peter's non-receipt claims fail.**

---

### 7.3 Bad Faith and Unclean Hands

**Legal Principle:** Party seeking equitable relief must come to court with clean hands.

**Application:**
- Peter (or Rynette on his behalf) controls `Pete@regima.com` email address
- Peter allows Rynette to filter information flow
- Peter then claims non-receipt or inadequate information
- Peter seeks interdict based on claims contradicted by controlled email address

**Conclusion:** Peter's conduct (allowing information filtering, then claiming non-receipt) violates clean hands doctrine and bars equitable relief.

---
