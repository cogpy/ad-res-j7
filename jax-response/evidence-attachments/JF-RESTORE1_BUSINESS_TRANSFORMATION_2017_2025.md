### The Irony

- Daniel invested R1.5M+ personally
- Peter claims mismanagement
- 1,492% growth proves otherwise

## CONCLUSION

This evidence demonstrates:

1. **Transformation**: Daniel transformed a dying R1.2M local business into a thriving R19.1M international enterprise

2. **Investment**: R1.5M+ personal investment plus 29,000 hours over 8 years

3. **Results**: 1,492% revenue growth, 8,900% customer growth, 37 markets

4. **Value Creation**: Built technology infrastructure worth R20M+

5. **Peter's Benefit**: Enjoyed massive value increase then destroyed it

6. **Bad Faith**: Peter's complaints about IT expenses ignore that IT created the entire value

The evidence proves Daniel's 8-year dedication built extraordinary value that Peter first benefited from, then destroyed through his malicious interdict.
