**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Version:** v4 (REVISED_Answering_Affidavit_Jax_TRACKED_CHANGES_v4.md)

## Major Addition: Section 13B - The Applicant's Contradictory Conduct

This new section (paragraphs 148.1-150.3) exposes the fundamental contradictions in Peter's conduct and proves he manufactured the crisis to justify an unnecessary interdict.

### Subsection 1: The Suspicious Timeline (Paragraphs 148.1-148.10)

**Key Point:** Peter cancelled all business cards THE DAY AFTER Daniel provided reports to the accountant.

**Timeline Established:**

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Mid-June 2025 | Daniel provides all reports to accountant Bantjes | Daniel cooperated fully |
| **Next day** | **Peter secretly cancels all business cards** | **Peter creates crisis without warning** |
| June 2025 | Services halted, domains down | Peter's actions cause operational chaos |
| June-July 2025 | Peter demands documentation from Daniel | Peter demands what his own actions made impossible |
| 11 August 2025 | Settlement agreement signed (JF5) | Suspicious timing |
| **13 August 2025** | **Peter files urgent ex parte interdict** | **2 days after settlement—coordinated attack** |

**Strategic Value:**
- Proves premeditation
- Shows Peter manufactured the crisis
- Demonstrates Peter set a trap
- Exposes bad faith

**Evidence Required:**
- JF-BANTJES-DATE: Date Daniel provided reports
- JF-CANCEL-DATE: Date Peter cancelled cards (day after)
- JF-NO-WARN: No warning before cancellation
- JF-DISRUPT: Operational disruption evidence

---

### Subsection 2: The Unnecessary Interdict (Paragraphs 149.1-149.13)

**Key Point:** Peter has absolute trust powers but bypassed them to seek an urgent interdict.

**Peter's Existing Powers:**
- Founder, trustee, and beneficiary of Faucitt Family Trust
- **Absolute and unlimited authority** over trust and companies
- Daniel: beneficiary only, **no powers**, not even right to respond

**What Peter Could Have Done Through Trust:**
- Convened trustee meeting
- Removed directors
- Changed banking authorities
- Commissioned forensic investigation
- Restructured management
- Implemented financial controls

**What Peter Actually Did:**
- Bypassed ALL internal processes
- Sought urgent ex parte interdict
- Obtained sweeping relief without notice
- Avoided scrutiny and accountability

**Why Did Peter Need the Interdict?**

The affidavit identifies four logical explanations:

1. **Avoid trust formalities** - Proper procedures would require documentation
2. **Create public record** - Discredit Jax and Daniel beyond financial control
3. **Freeze assets** - Control ahead of May 2026 investment payout
4. **Avoid scrutiny** - Claims wouldn't survive proper trust governance

**Material Non-Disclosure:**

Peter's failure to disclose his absolute trust powers is itself a material non-disclosure:
- Court not told Peter already has absolute control
- Court not told Peter could act through trust
- Court not told interdict was unnecessary
- Court misled into granting unnecessary relief

**Strategic Value:**
- Exposes fundamental contradiction in Peter's case
- Proves interdict was unnecessary
- Establishes additional material non-disclosure
- Provides grounds for setting aside interim order

**Evidence Required:**
- JF-TRUST-DEED: Trust deed showing Peter's absolute powers
- JF-DAN-BENEFICIARY: Daniel's limited beneficiary status
- JF-TRUST-HISTORY: Peter's historical exercise of trust powers
- JF-TIMELINE-SETTLEMENT: Timeline showing 2-day gap

---

### Subsection 3: The Pattern of Bad Faith (Paragraphs 150.1-150.3)

**Key Point:** Peter's conduct reveals a systematic pattern of bad faith.

**Six Elements of the Pattern:**

1. **Manufactured Crisis** - Card cancellations created the problems Peter complains about
2. **Impossible Demands** - Demanded documentation while making it impossible to provide
3. **Bypassing Existing Powers** - Sought interdict despite having absolute trust powers
4. **Suspicious Timing** - Filed 2 days after settlement, 9 months before major payout
5. **Material Non-Disclosures** - Multiple failures to disclose material facts in ex parte
6. **Coordinated Attack** - Settlement agreement as Trojan horse, then immediate interdict

**Conclusion:**

"This is not the conduct of a director genuinely concerned about financial misconduct. This is the conduct of someone orchestrating a crisis to justify seizing control."

**Strategic Value:**
- Synthesizes all evidence of bad faith
- Transforms narrative from defensive to offensive
- Exposes Peter's true motive
- Provides compelling argument for setting aside interim order

## Impact on Overall Affidavit

### Narrative Transformation

**Before v4:**
- Defensive: "We didn't do anything wrong"
- Reactive: Responding to Peter's allegations
- Fragmented: Individual rebuttals without overarching narrative

**After v4:**
- Offensive: "Peter orchestrated this entire crisis"
- Proactive: Exposing Peter's manufactured pretext
- Cohesive: Clear pattern of bad faith with timeline and evidence

### Strategic Advantages

1. **Proves Premeditation** - Timeline shows Peter planned this attack
2. **Establishes Causation** - Peter's actions caused the problems he complains about
3. **Exposes Contradiction** - Why seek interdict when you have absolute trust powers?
4. **Demonstrates Bad Faith** - Pattern of conduct reveals true motive
5. **Material Non-Disclosure** - Additional grounds for setting aside interim order
6. **Connects to Major Payout** - Exposes financial motive (May 2026 investment)

### Legal Grounds Strengthened

1. **Setting Aside Interim Order** - Multiple material non-disclosures proven
2. **Abuse of Process** - Unnecessary interdict given existing trust powers
3. **Lack of Urgency** - Manufactured crisis, not genuine emergency
4. **Lack of Good Faith** - Pattern of bad faith conduct established
5. **Ulterior Motive** - Financial control ahead of major payout

## Next Steps

### Before Filing:

1. **Gather Evidence** - Collect all annexures listed in Section 13B
2. **Verify Dates** - Confirm exact dates for timeline
3. **Trust Deed Review** - Ensure trust deed provisions support claims about Peter's powers
4. **Legal Review** - Attorney approval of new section
5. **Cross-Reference** - Ensure consistency with other sections

### Critical Evidence Needed:

**High Priority:**
- JF-BANTJES-DATE (date Daniel provided reports)
- JF-CANCEL-DATE (date Peter cancelled cards - must be day after)
- JF-TRUST-DEED (Peter's absolute powers)
- JF-TIMELINE-SETTLEMENT (2-day gap between settlement and interdict)

**Medium Priority:**
- JF-NO-WARN (no warning before cancellation)
- JF-DISRUPT (operational disruption evidence)
- JF-DAN-BENEFICIARY (Daniel's limited status)
- JF-TRUST-HISTORY (Peter's historical exercise of powers)

Version 4 represents a **transformative upgrade** to the affidavit. By adding Section 13B, the affidavit now:

1. **Proves Peter manufactured the crisis** (timeline of card cancellations)
2. **Exposes the unnecessary interdict** (Peter's absolute trust powers)
3. **Establishes pattern of bad faith** (six elements synthesized)
4. **Provides additional grounds** for setting aside interim order
5. **Transforms the narrative** from defensive to offensive

**Version 4 is now the current version to use going forward.**
