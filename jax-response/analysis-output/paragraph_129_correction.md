### CORRECTED Statement:

**129. Isaac Chesno Fraud and Daniel's Restoration of UK Operations**

üîµ **NEW CONTENT - CORRECTING MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT**

129.1 The Applicant's reference to the former UK managing director, Isaac Chesno, requires clarification and correction of the record.

129.2 **Isaac Chesno's Fraud:**

129.2.1 Isaac Chesno, the former UK managing director, **committed massive fraud** against RegimA UK Ltd.

129.2.2 Mr. Chesno misappropriated **over ¬£500,000 (five hundred thousand pounds sterling)** from the UK company.

129.2.3 Following discovery of the fraud, Mr. Chesno **disappeared** and could not be located for prosecution or recovery proceedings.

129.2.4 The fraud left RegimA UK Ltd in **substantial debt** and on the verge of insolvency.

129.2.5 Documentary evidence of the fraud includes:
- Forensic accounting reports (Annexure **JF-CHESNO1**);
- Bank statements showing unauthorized transfers (Annexure **JF-CHESNO2**);
- Police reports and fraud investigation records (Annexure **JF-CHESNO3**);
- Insolvency assessment as of [date] (Annexure **JF-CHESNO4**).

129.3 **Daniel's Eight-Year Restoration Effort:**

129.3.1 Following the Chesno fraud, the Second Respondent (Daniel) was appointed as managing director of RegimA UK Ltd specifically to **rescue the company from insolvency** and restore it to financial viability.

129.3.2 This appointment was **necessitated by the fraud**, not "arising from alleged wrongdoing" as the Applicant misleadingly suggests.

129.3.3 The Second Respondent undertook an **ongoing restoration effort** to:
- Manage the company's transition to dormant status while preserving its legal structure;
- Gradually repay creditors of RegimA UK Ltd and its subsidiaries using profits from new business ventures;
- Preserve the accumulated tax losses (exceeding GBP 650,000) which make restoration to trading status worthwhile in the long term;
- Implement proper financial controls to prevent future fraud;
- Maintain the company structure for eventual return to trading operations when financially viable.

129.3.4 The Second Respondent established RegimA UK Ltd as a **dormant holding company since 2015**, protecting the substantial accumulated tax losses (exceeding GBP 650,000) which provide significant value for future restoration to trading status. Daniel started several new companies and is **gradually using the profits from these new ventures to pay creditors** of RegimA UK Ltd and its subsidiaries as often as possible.

129.3.5 Documentary evidence of this restoration effort includes:
- Companies House filings showing dormant company status from 2015 onwards (Annexure **JF-RESTORE1**);
- Documentation of accumulated tax losses exceeding GBP 650,000 (Annexure **JF-RESTORE2**);
- Correspondence with creditors showing periodic debt repayment from Daniel's new venture profits (Annexure **JF-RESTORE3**);
- Evidence of Daniel's new business ventures established to generate funds for creditor repayment (Annexure **JF-RESTORE4**).

129.4 **The Applicant's Misleading Characterization:**

129.4.1 The Applicant's suggestion that the Second Respondent's appointment "arose from alleged wrongdoing" is **deliberately misleading** and inverts the truth.

129.4.2 The Second Respondent's appointment arose **because of someone else's wrongdoing** (Chesno's fraud), not from any wrongdoing by the Second Respondent.

129.4.3 The Second Respondent's appointment was based on:
- **Crisis management capability** - ability to navigate a company through fraud-induced insolvency;
- **Financial acumen** - ability to structure dormant status to preserve tax losses and manage gradual creditor repayment;
- **Entrepreneurial skill** - ability to start new ventures generating profits for creditor repayment;
- **Integrity and trustworthiness** - precisely the qualities lacking in his predecessor;
- **Proven track record** - successfully preserving GBP 650,000+ tax losses while establishing new businesses to fund gradual debt recovery.

129.5 **Relevance to Current Proceedings:**

129.5.1 The Chesno fraud and Daniel's successful restoration are directly relevant to this matter because they demonstrate:

**(a) Daniel's Competence:** The strategic management of RegimA UK Ltd as a dormant holding company to preserve substantial tax losses, combined with establishing new ventures to generate profits for gradual creditor repayment, demonstrates Daniel's business competence and contradicts the Applicant's allegations of financial mismanagement.

**(b) Daniel's Integrity:** Daniel could have walked away from the fraud-damaged UK company; instead, he has maintained it as a dormant holding company since 2015, started new business ventures, and is gradually using profits from those ventures to repay creditors, demonstrating long-term commitment to the RegimA businesses and their stakeholders.

**(c) Applicant's Bad Faith:** The Applicant's deliberate mischaracterization of Daniel's appointment as "arising from alleged wrongdoing" demonstrates the Applicant's willingness to distort facts to support his narrative.

**(d) Pattern of Misrepresentation:** Just as the Applicant misrepresents Daniel's appointment, he misrepresents the R500,000 payment, the IT expenses, and the settlement agreement.

129.6 **The Applicant's Knowledge:**

129.6.1 The Applicant was **fully aware** of the Chesno fraud at the time it occurred.

129.6.2 The Applicant was **fully aware** of Daniel's strategy to maintain RegimA UK Ltd as a dormant holding company and gradually repay creditors using profits from new ventures.

129.6.3 The Applicant **participated in decisions** regarding the UK company's recovery strategy.

129.6.4 The Applicant's current mischaracterization is therefore **deliberate and knowing**, not a mistake or misunderstanding.

‚ö†Ô∏è **STRATEGIC NOTE:** This correction is critical because it:
1. Exposes the Applicant's willingness to deliberately misrepresent facts
2. Demonstrates Daniel's competence and integrity through strategic management of dormant company status and entrepreneurial creditor repayment approach
3. Shows the Applicant's bad faith in characterizing rescue efforts as "arising from wrongdoing"
4. Provides concrete evidence of Daniel's business acumen (preserving GBP 650,000+ tax losses while generating funds for gradual debt recovery)
