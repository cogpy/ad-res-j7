### CORRECTED Statement:

**129. Isaac Chesno Fraud and Daniel's Restoration of UK Operations**

üîµ **NEW CONTENT - CORRECTING MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT**

129.1 The Applicant's reference to the former UK managing director, Isaac Chesno, requires clarification and correction of the record.

129.2 **Isaac Chesno's Fraud:**

129.2.1 Isaac Chesno, the former UK managing director, **committed massive fraud** against RegimA UK Ltd.

129.2.2 Mr. Chesno misappropriated **over ¬£500,000 (five hundred thousand pounds sterling)** from the UK company.

129.2.3 Following discovery of the fraud, Mr. Chesno **disappeared** and could not be located for prosecution or recovery proceedings.

129.2.4 The fraud left RegimA UK Ltd in **substantial debt** and on the verge of insolvency.

129.2.5 Documentary evidence of the fraud includes:
- Forensic accounting reports (Annexure **JF-CHESNO1**);
- Bank statements showing unauthorized transfers (Annexure **JF-CHESNO2**);
- Police reports and fraud investigation records (Annexure **JF-CHESNO3**);
- Insolvency assessment as of [date] (Annexure **JF-CHESNO4**).

129.3 **The Reality: Daniel's Rescue of an Abandoned Business:**

129.3.1 The characterization that Daniel was "appointed as managing director" fundamentally mischaracterises what actually occurred. The reality is:

129.3.2 **Peter's Pattern of Business Conduct:**

129.3.2.1 The Applicant (Peter) had entered into an unconditional multi-decade contract with Isaac Chesno regarding the UK operations.

129.3.2.2 When Chesno committed fraud and the business faced insolvency, the Applicant **abandoned the struggling UK business** at the first sign of serious trouble.

129.3.2.3 The Applicant then sought to blame others for the crisis he had enabled through his initial decision to enter unconditional agreements with unsuitable parties.

129.3.3 **Daniel's Business Rescue - Not a Traditional "Appointment":**

129.3.3.1 Following the Chesno fraud and the Applicant's abandonment of the failing business, the Second Respondent (Daniel) **stepped in to rescue RegimA UK Ltd from insolvency** and restore it to financial viability.

129.3.3.2 There was no traditional "authority to appoint" in the formal sense that the term "appointed" suggests. Rather, this was a **business rescue and acquisition situation** where Daniel took responsibility for a failing entity that others (including the Applicant) had abandoned.

129.3.3.3 This was **not an isolated incident** but part of a broader pattern over the years: the Applicant would sign unconditional multi-decade contracts with strangers, and when problems inevitably arose, Daniel would rescue the failing operations while the Applicant blamed him for "letting it happen."

129.3.4 **Daniel's Eight-Year Restoration Effort:**

129.3.4.1 The Second Respondent undertook an **eight-year restoration effort** to:
- Repay the debts created by Chesno's fraud;
- Rebuild customer and supplier relationships damaged by the fraud;
- Restore the company's reputation in UK markets;
- Implement proper financial controls to prevent future fraud;
- Manage the company's transition to dormant status while preserving its legal structure;
- Preserve the accumulated tax losses (exceeding GBP 650,000) which make restoration to trading status worthwhile in the long term.

129.3.4.2 The Second Respondent established RegimA UK Ltd as a **dormant holding company since 2015**, protecting the substantial accumulated tax losses (exceeding GBP 650,000) which provide significant value for future restoration to trading status. Daniel started several new companies and is **gradually using the profits from these new ventures to pay creditors** of RegimA UK Ltd and its subsidiaries as often as possible.

129.3.4.3 As of [date], through this strategic approach, the Second Respondent successfully stabilized RegimA UK Ltd's financial position, a remarkable achievement given the magnitude of the fraud and debt he inherited after the Applicant's abandonment.

129.3.5 **The Pattern Across Multiple Businesses:**

129.3.5.1 The UK situation with Chesno is **not an isolated incident** but exemplifies a recurring pattern in the RegimA businesses:
- The Applicant signs unconditional multi-decade contracts with individuals without adequate due diligence;
- When those individuals prove unsuitable or problems arise, the Applicant abandons the struggling business;
- Daniel steps in to rescue the failing operation;
- The Applicant later blames Daniel for the problems that arose from the Applicant's own decisions.

129.3.5.2 This pattern has repeated across **various businesses acquired over the years** when original parties "jumped ship" and Daniel rescued the operations. The characterization of these rescues as formal "appointments" fundamentally misrepresents the nature of Daniel's involvement.

129.3.6 Documentary evidence of this restoration effort includes:
- Companies House filings showing dormant company status from 2015 onwards (Annexure **JF-RESTORE1**);
- Documentation of accumulated tax losses exceeding GBP 650,000 (Annexure **JF-RESTORE2**);
- Correspondence with creditors showing periodic debt repayment from Daniel's new venture profits (Annexure **JF-RESTORE3**);
- Evidence of Daniel's new business ventures established to generate funds for creditor repayment (Annexure **JF-RESTORE4**).

129.4 **The Applicant's Misleading Characterization:**

129.4.1 Every reference to "Daniel Faucitt was appointed as director of RegimA Ltd" is **misleading and fundamentally mischaracterises** the relationship between the companies and parties.

129.4.2 The Applicant's suggestion that Daniel's role "arose from alleged wrongdoing" is **deliberately misleading** and inverts the truth.

129.4.3 The reality is that Daniel's involvement arose **because of someone else's wrongdoing** (Chesno's fraud) **combined with the Applicant's abandonment** of the failing business, not from any wrongdoing by Daniel.

129.4.4 The characterization as a formal "appointment" obscures the true nature of the situation. The Second Respondent's involvement was based on:
- **Crisis management capability** - ability to navigate a company through fraud-induced insolvency;
- **Financial acumen** - ability to structure dormant status to preserve tax losses (GBP 650,000+) and manage gradual creditor repayment over 8 years;
- **Entrepreneurial skill** - ability to start new ventures generating profits for creditor repayment;
- **Operational expertise** - ability to rescue an insolvent company and stabilize business operations;
- **Integrity and trustworthiness** - precisely the qualities lacking in his predecessor;
- **Proven track record** - successfully stabilizing RegimA UK Ltd after inheriting ¬£500K+ fraud debt that resulted from the Applicant's abandoned business decisions.

129.5 **Relevance to Current Proceedings:**

129.5.1 The Chesno fraud, the Applicant's abandonment, and Daniel's successful business rescue are directly relevant to this matter because they demonstrate:

**(a) Daniel's Competence:** The strategic management of RegimA UK Ltd as a dormant holding company to preserve substantial tax losses (GBP 650,000+), combined with establishing new ventures to generate profits for gradual creditor repayment, demonstrates Daniel's business competence and contradicts the Applicant's allegations of financial mismanagement.

**(b) Daniel's Integrity:** Daniel could have walked away from the fraud-damaged UK company that the Applicant had abandoned; instead, he has maintained it as a dormant holding company since 2015, started new business ventures, and is gradually using profits from those ventures to repay creditors over 8 years, demonstrating long-term commitment to the RegimA businesses and their stakeholders.

**(c) The Applicant's Pattern of Conduct:** The UK situation exemplifies the Applicant's recurring pattern - signing unconditional multi-decade contracts with unsuitable parties, abandoning businesses at the first sign of trouble, then blaming Daniel. **This is precisely what is happening in the current proceedings.**

**(d) Applicant's Bad Faith:** The Applicant's deliberate mischaracterization of Daniel's business rescue as a formal "appointment arising from alleged wrongdoing" demonstrates the Applicant's willingness to distort facts to support his narrative.

**(e) Pattern of Misrepresentation:** Just as the Applicant misrepresents Daniel's rescue of abandoned businesses as formal "appointments," he misrepresents the R500,000 payment, the IT expenses, and the settlement agreement.

129.6 **The Applicant's Knowledge and Participation:**

129.6.1 The Applicant was **fully aware** of the Chesno fraud at the time it occurred - it was a crisis in a business where he had signed the unconditional contract with Chesno.

129.6.2 The Applicant was **fully aware** that he had abandoned the failing UK business and that Daniel stepped in to rescue it.

129.6.3 The Applicant was **fully aware** of Daniel's eight-year restoration effort and benefited from Daniel's rescue of the failing business.

129.6.4 The Applicant was **fully aware** of Daniel's strategy to maintain RegimA UK Ltd as a dormant holding company and gradually repay creditors using profits from new ventures.

129.6.5 The Applicant **initially participated in decisions** regarding the UK company's recovery strategy before abandoning the troubled business to Daniel.

129.6.6 The Applicant's current mischaracterization of Daniel's business rescue as a formal "appointment" is therefore **deliberate and knowing**, not a mistake or misunderstanding.

129.6.7 The Applicant's attempt to now characterize Daniel's rescue efforts as "arising from wrongdoing" while concealing his own role in creating the crisis and abandoning the business demonstrates profound bad faith.

‚ö†Ô∏è **STRATEGIC NOTE:** This correction is critical because it:
1. Exposes the fundamental mischaracterization in every reference to Daniel being "appointed as director"
2. Reveals the Applicant's pattern: signing unconditional contracts ‚Üí abandoning at first trouble ‚Üí blaming Daniel
3. Demonstrates this pattern is repeating in the current proceedings
4. Shows Daniel's role was business rescue of abandoned entities, not formal appointment
5. Proves the Applicant's willingness to deliberately misrepresent facts
6. Demonstrates Daniel's competence and integrity through strategic management of dormant company status and entrepreneurial creditor repayment approach over 8 years
7. Provides concrete evidence of Daniel's business acumen (preserving GBP 650,000+ tax losses while generating funds for gradual debt recovery from ¬£500K+ fraud)
8. Establishes there was no traditional "authority to appoint" - these were rescue acquisitions of struggling businesses
