### CORRECTED Statement:

**129. Isaac Chesno Fraud and Daniel's Restoration of UK Operations**

üîµ **NEW CONTENT - CORRECTING MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT**

129.1 The Applicant's reference to the former UK managing director, Isaac Chesno, requires clarification and correction of the record.

129.2 **Isaac Chesno's Fraud:**

129.2.1 Isaac Chesno, the former UK managing director, **committed massive fraud** against RegimA UK Ltd.

129.2.2 Mr. Chesno misappropriated **over ¬£500,000 (five hundred thousand pounds sterling)** from the UK company.

129.2.3 Following discovery of the fraud, Mr. Chesno **disappeared** and could not be located for prosecution or recovery proceedings.

129.2.4 The fraud left RegimA UK Ltd in **substantial debt** and on the verge of insolvency.

129.2.5 Documentary evidence of the fraud includes:
- Forensic accounting reports (Annexure **JF-CHESNO1**);
- Bank statements showing unauthorized transfers (Annexure **JF-CHESNO2**);
- Police reports and fraud investigation records (Annexure **JF-CHESNO3**);
- Insolvency assessment as of [date] (Annexure **JF-CHESNO4**).

129.3 **Daniel's Eight-Year Restoration Effort:**

129.3.1 Following the Chesno fraud, the Second Respondent (Daniel) was appointed as managing director of RegimA UK Ltd specifically to **rescue the company from insolvency** and restore it to financial viability.

129.3.2 This appointment was **necessitated by the fraud**, not "arising from alleged wrongdoing" as the Applicant misleadingly suggests.

129.3.3 The Second Respondent undertook an **eight-year restoration effort** to:
- Repay the debts created by Chesno's fraud;
- Rebuild customer and supplier relationships damaged by the fraud;
- Restore the company's reputation in UK markets;
- Implement proper financial controls to prevent future fraud;
- Return the company to break-even operations.

129.3.4 As of [date], the Second Respondent successfully restored RegimA UK Ltd to **break-even operations**, a remarkable achievement given the magnitude of the fraud and debt he inherited.

129.3.5 Documentary evidence of this restoration includes:
- Financial statements showing progressive debt reduction from [year] to [year] (Annexure **JF-RESTORE1**);
- Management accounts demonstrating return to break-even (Annexure **JF-RESTORE2**);
- Correspondence with creditors showing debt repayment (Annexure **JF-RESTORE3**);
- Customer testimonials regarding restored service levels (Annexure **JF-RESTORE4**).

129.4 **The Applicant's Misleading Characterization:**

129.4.1 The Applicant's suggestion that the Second Respondent's appointment "arose from alleged wrongdoing" is **deliberately misleading** and inverts the truth.

129.4.2 The Second Respondent's appointment arose **because of someone else's wrongdoing** (Chesno's fraud), not from any wrongdoing by the Second Respondent.

129.4.3 The Second Respondent's appointment was based on:
- **Crisis management capability** - ability to rescue an insolvent company;
- **Financial acumen** - ability to manage debt repayment over 8 years;
- **Operational expertise** - ability to restore business operations;
- **Integrity and trustworthiness** - precisely the qualities lacking in his predecessor;
- **Proven track record** - successfully achieving break-even after inheriting ¬£500K+ fraud debt.

129.5 **Relevance to Current Proceedings:**

129.5.1 The Chesno fraud and Daniel's successful restoration are directly relevant to this matter because they demonstrate:

**(a) Daniel's Competence:** Eight years of successful crisis management and debt recovery prove Daniel's business competence, contradicting the Applicant's allegations of financial mismanagement.

**(b) Daniel's Integrity:** Daniel could have walked away from the fraud-damaged UK company; instead, he spent 8 years restoring it, demonstrating commitment to the RegimA businesses.

**(c) Applicant's Bad Faith:** The Applicant's deliberate mischaracterization of Daniel's appointment as "arising from alleged wrongdoing" demonstrates the Applicant's willingness to distort facts to support his narrative.

**(d) Pattern of Misrepresentation:** Just as the Applicant misrepresents Daniel's appointment, he misrepresents the R500,000 payment, the IT expenses, and the settlement agreement.

129.6 **The Applicant's Knowledge:**

129.6.1 The Applicant was **fully aware** of the Chesno fraud at the time it occurred.

129.6.2 The Applicant was **fully aware** of Daniel's eight-year restoration effort.

129.6.3 The Applicant **participated in decisions** regarding the UK company's recovery strategy.

129.6.4 The Applicant's current mischaracterization is therefore **deliberate and knowing**, not a mistake or misunderstanding.

‚ö†Ô∏è **STRATEGIC NOTE:** This correction is critical because it:
1. Exposes the Applicant's willingness to deliberately misrepresent facts
2. Demonstrates Daniel's competence and integrity through 8 years of crisis management
3. Shows the Applicant's bad faith in characterizing rescue efforts as "arising from wrongdoing"
4. Provides concrete evidence of Daniel's business acumen (¬£500K+ fraud recovery)
