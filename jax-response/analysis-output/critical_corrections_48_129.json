          "content": "**129. Isaac Chesno Fraud and Daniel's Restoration of UK Operations**\n\nüîµ **NEW CONTENT - CORRECTING MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT**\n\n129.1 The Applicant's reference to the former UK managing director, Isaac Chesno, requires clarification and correction of the record.\n\n129.2 **Isaac Chesno's Fraud:**\n\n129.2.1 Isaac Chesno, the former UK managing director, **committed massive fraud** against RegimA UK Ltd.\n\n129.2.2 Mr. Chesno misappropriated **over ¬£500,000 (five hundred thousand pounds sterling)** from the UK company.\n\n129.2.3 Following discovery of the fraud, Mr. Chesno **disappeared** and could not be located for prosecution or recovery proceedings.\n\n129.2.4 The fraud left RegimA UK Ltd in **substantial debt** and on the verge of insolvency.\n\n129.2.5 Documentary evidence of the fraud includes:\n- Forensic accounting reports (Annexure **JF-CHESNO1**);\n- Bank statements showing unauthorized transfers (Annexure **JF-CHESNO2**);\n- Police reports and fraud investigation records (Annexure **JF-CHESNO3**);\n- Insolvency assessment as of [date] (Annexure **JF-CHESNO4**).\n\n129.3 **Daniel's Eight-Year Restoration Effort:**\n\n129.3.1 Following the Chesno fraud, the Second Respondent (Daniel) was appointed as managing director of RegimA UK Ltd specifically to **rescue the company from insolvency** and restore it to financial viability.\n\n129.3.2 This appointment was **necessitated by the fraud**, not \"arising from alleged wrongdoing\" as the Applicant misleadingly suggests.\n\n129.3.3 The Second Respondent undertook an **eight-year restoration effort** to:\n- Repay the debts created by Chesno's fraud;\n- Rebuild customer and supplier relationships damaged by the fraud;\n- Restore the company's reputation in UK markets;\n- Implement proper financial controls to prevent future fraud;\n- Return the company to break-even operations.\n\n129.3.4 As of [date], the Second Respondent successfully restored RegimA UK Ltd to **break-even operations**, a remarkable achievement given the magnitude of the fraud and debt he inherited.\n\n129.3.5 Documentary evidence of this restoration includes:\n- Financial statements showing progressive debt reduction from [year] to [year] (Annexure **JF-RESTORE1**);\n- Management accounts demonstrating return to break-even (Annexure **JF-RESTORE2**);\n- Correspondence with creditors showing debt repayment (Annexure **JF-RESTORE3**);\n- Customer testimonials regarding restored service levels (Annexure **JF-RESTORE4**).\n\n129.4 **The Applicant's Misleading Characterization:**\n\n129.4.1 The Applicant's suggestion that the Second Respondent's appointment \"arose from alleged wrongdoing\" is **deliberately misleading** and inverts the truth.\n\n129.4.2 The Second Respondent's appointment arose **because of someone else's wrongdoing** (Chesno's fraud), not from any wrongdoing by the Second Respondent.\n\n129.4.3 The Second Respondent's appointment was based on:\n- **Crisis management capability** - ability to rescue an insolvent company;\n- **Financial acumen** - ability to manage debt repayment over 8 years;\n- **Operational expertise** - ability to restore business operations;\n- **Integrity and trustworthiness** - precisely the qualities lacking in his predecessor;\n- **Proven track record** - successfully achieving break-even after inheriting ¬£500K+ fraud debt.\n\n129.5 **Relevance to Current Proceedings:**\n\n129.5.1 The Chesno fraud and Daniel's successful restoration are directly relevant to this matter because they demonstrate:\n\n**(a) Daniel's Competence:** Eight years of successful crisis management and debt recovery prove Daniel's business competence, contradicting the Applicant's allegations of financial mismanagement.\n\n**(b) Daniel's Integrity:** Daniel could have walked away from the fraud-damaged UK company; instead, he spent 8 years restoring it, demonstrating commitment to the RegimA businesses.\n\n**(c) Applicant's Bad Faith:** The Applicant's deliberate mischaracterization of Daniel's appointment as \"arising from alleged wrongdoing\" demonstrates the Applicant's willingness to distort facts to support his narrative.\n\n**(d) Pattern of Misrepresentation:** Just as the Applicant misrepresents Daniel's appointment, he misrepresents the R500,000 payment, the IT expenses, and the settlement agreement.\n\n129.6 **The Applicant's Knowledge:**\n\n129.6.1 The Applicant was **fully aware** of the Chesno fraud at the time it occurred.\n\n129.6.2 The Applicant was **fully aware** of Daniel's eight-year restoration effort.\n\n129.6.3 The Applicant **participated in decisions** regarding the UK company's recovery strategy.\n\n129.6.4 The Applicant's current mischaracterization is therefore **deliberate and knowing**, not a mistake or misunderstanding.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è **STRATEGIC NOTE:** This correction is critical because it:\n1. Exposes the Applicant's willingness to deliberately misrepresent facts\n2. Demonstrates Daniel's competence and integrity through 8 years of crisis management\n3. Shows the Applicant's bad faith in characterizing rescue efforts as \"arising from wrongdoing\"\n4. Provides concrete evidence of Daniel's business acumen (¬£500K+ fraud recovery)\n\n---\n\n**EVIDENCE CHECKLIST FOR CORRECTED PARAGRAPH 129:**\n\n‚òê Forensic accounting reports re: Chesno fraud (Annexure JF-CHESNO1)\n‚òê Bank statements showing unauthorized transfers (Annexure JF-CHESNO2)\n‚òê Police reports and fraud investigation records (Annexure JF-CHESNO3)\n‚òê Insolvency assessment pre-Daniel appointment (Annexure JF-CHESNO4)\n‚òê Financial statements showing debt reduction over 8 years (Annexure JF-RESTORE1)\n‚òê Management accounts showing return to break-even (Annexure JF-RESTORE2)\n‚òê Correspondence with creditors re: debt repayment (Annexure JF-RESTORE3)\n‚òê Customer testimonials re: restored service (Annexure JF-RESTORE4)\n‚òê Board minutes appointing Daniel as managing director (with context of fraud)\n‚òê Evidence of Applicant's knowledge and participation in recovery decisions\n\n---\n\n**END OF CORRECTIONS**"
