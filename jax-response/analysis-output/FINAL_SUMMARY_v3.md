## Critical Corrections in Version 3

### 1. Paragraph 48 Correction - Gauteng Family Law Forum

**What Was Wrong:**
Original version stated that the Gauteng Family Law Forum was mentioned in the draft we reviewed.

**What's Correct:**
- We did NOT see "Gauteng Family Law Forum" in the version we reviewed
- This reference was added as part of the "details for the attorneys"
- We understood "details for the attorneys" to mean contact information, not substantive changes
- The final agreement has TWO separate "bear costs" clauses - evidence of hasty copy-paste editing

**Why This Matters:**
- Demonstrates the attorneys added substantive provisions, not just "details"
- The duplicate clauses prove last-minute editing
- Strengthens fraud in the inducement argument

### 2. Paragraph 129 Correction - Isaac Chesno Fraud

**What Was Wrong:**
Original paragraph 129 denied any fraud by Isaac Chesno and characterized it as "alleged wrongdoing."

**What's Correct:**
- Isaac Chesno committed massive fraud (over £500,000)
- Chesno disappeared after the fraud
- Left UK company in substantial debt
- Daniel spent 8 YEARS restoring the company to break-even
- Daniel's appointment was BECAUSE of Chesno's fraud, not "arising from wrongdoing"

**Why This Matters:**
- Demonstrates Daniel's competence (8-year crisis management success)
- Shows Daniel's integrity (could have walked away, chose to restore)
- Exposes Peter's deliberate misrepresentation
- Proves Daniel's business acumen (£500K+ debt recovery)
- Establishes pattern: Peter misrepresents facts to support his narrative

---

## Key Strategic Elements in Final Version

### 1. Material Non-Disclosure Framework (Section 2)
Establishes that Peter failed to disclose:
- Jax's Responsible Person role (37 jurisdictions)
- Settlement agreement signed 8 days before interdict
- Investment payout in 9 months
- Rynette's unprecedented access
- Peter's own unilateral actions causing disruption
- Historical collaborative model
- Director loan account structure

### 2. Responsible Person Compliance Crisis (Section 3)
- Detailed legal requirements across 37 jurisdictions
- Personal liability under EU Regulation 1223/2009
- Non-delegable duties
- Immediate regulatory non-compliance created by interdict
- Potential penalties, recalls, market access loss

### 3. IT Expenses Contextualization (Section 7.2)
- International operations across 37 jurisdictions require substantial IT
- Peter restricted access to documentation systems
- Then claimed expenses were "unexplained"
- Peter created the problem he now complains about

### 4. R500K Payment - Peter's Inconsistency (Section 7.8)
- Director loan account structure (millions in credit balances)
- Established practice for years (no board resolutions required)
- Peter received similar payments numerous times
- Peter's sudden objection is inconsistent and pretextual
- Timing demonstrates pretext (payment → 20 days → attorney → 28 days → interdict)

### 5. Settlement Agreement Manipulation (Section 13A)
- "Has anything changed?" - "No, just details for attorneys"
- Material misrepresentation
- "Parties" changed to "parties' attorneys" throughout
- Gauteng Family Law Forum added without disclosure
- Duplicate "bear costs" clauses prove hasty editing
- Scope expanded to open-ended "treatments"
- UK tax residency makes attorney control particularly problematic
- Fraud in the inducement - agreement should be void/voidable

### 6. Rynette's Expanding Access (Section 12)
- Historical collaborative model operated successfully for years
- Peter systematically granted Rynette (non-director bookkeeper):
  - Access to all bank accounts
  - All his passwords and login credentials
  - Signatory authority on multiple accounts
  - Ability to transact unilaterally
- Concurrent exclusion of directors
- Peter characterized director oversight as "interference"
- Breakdown caused by Peter, not respondents

### 7. Isaac Chesno Fraud (Paragraph 129 - to be inserted)
- Chesno committed £500K+ fraud
- Daniel rescued insolvent company
- 8-year restoration to break-even
- Peter's deliberate mischaracterization exposes bad faith
- Demonstrates pattern of misrepresentation

4. **Peter Caused the Breakdown:** Systematic exclusion of directors, transfer of control to non-director
5. **Timing Reveals Ulterior Motive:** Settlement manipulation → 2 days → interdict → 9 months → payout
6. **Pattern of Misrepresentation:** Settlement agreement, R500K payment, IT expenses, Chesno fraud
7. **Daniel's Proven Competence:** 8 years rescuing £500K+ fraud-damaged company
8. **Regulatory Crisis:** Interdict creates immediate non-compliance in 37 jurisdictions
