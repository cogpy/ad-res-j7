      "content": "üîµ **NEW CONTENT - STRATEGIC FRAMING**\n\n2.1 The purpose of this affidavit is to respond to the Applicant's founding affidavit and to place before this Honourable Court material facts that were not disclosed in the ex parte application that resulted in the interdict granted on 19 August 2025.\n\n2.2 **Material Non-Disclosure in Ex Parte Application:**\n\n2.2.1 The Applicant obtained the ex parte interdict by failing to make full and frank disclosure of material facts that would have caused this Honourable Court to refuse the relief sought or to craft substantially different relief.\n\n2.2.2 The duty of utmost good faith (*uberrima fides*) in ex parte applications requires an applicant to disclose all material facts, including those that may be adverse to the application.\n\n2.2.3 The Applicant failed to disclose the following material facts:\n\n**(a) My Role as Legally Designated Responsible Person:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that I serve as the legally designated \"Responsible Person\" for RegimA products in 37 international jurisdictions under EU Regulation 1223/2009 and equivalent laws, and that the interdict would prevent me from performing non-delegable legal duties, creating immediate regulatory non-compliance and exposing the businesses to substantial penalties, product recalls, and loss of market access.\n\n**(b) Settlement Agreement Signed 8 Days Before Interdict:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that he and I signed a settlement agreement on or about 11 August 2025, and that he filed this interdict application merely 2 days later (13 August 2025), suggesting the interdict is part of a coordinated strategy rather than a genuine response to urgent financial misconduct.\n\n**(c) Upcoming Investment Payout in 9 Months:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that a significant investment payout is due to mature in approximately May 2026 (9 months from the August 2025 interdict), suggesting a financial motive for gaining control of the businesses before this major financial event.\n\n**(d) Applicant's Transfer of Control to Non-Director Bookkeeper:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that he has systematically granted Ms. Rynette Farrar (a non-director bookkeeper) unprecedented access and authority, including: access to all bank accounts, all of his passwords and login credentials, signatory authority on multiple accounts, and ability to transact unilaterally without director approval.\n\n**(e) Applicant's Own Unilateral Actions Causing Business Disruption:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that he unilaterally cancelled all business cards in June 2025, restricted director access to systems, characterized director oversight as \"interference\", and excluded the First and Second Respondents from decision-making.\n\n**(f) Historical Collaborative Business Model:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that the RegimA businesses operated for [X] years with an informal, trust-based, collaborative model in which directors drew from loan accounts without formal board resolutions, and that the Applicant participated in and benefited from this model throughout its history.\n\n**(g) Director Loan Account Structure:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that directors maintain loan accounts with credit balances of several million rand, that companies owe directors substantial sums at all times, and that the Applicant himself has received similar payments without formal board resolutions on numerous occasions.\n\n2.2.4 Had this Honourable Court been aware of these material facts, the Court would likely have:\n- Refused to grant the ex parte interdict; or\n- Crafted substantially different relief that preserved my ability to perform non-delegable legal duties and that did not reward the Applicant's own misconduct.\n\n2.3 I will demonstrate in this affidavit that:\n\n2.3.1 The Applicant's material non-disclosures undermine the foundation of the ex parte interdict;\n\n2.3.2 The interdict creates immediate and serious compliance risks for the RegimA businesses in 37 international jurisdictions;\n\n2.3.3 The Applicant's objections to business expenses and the R500,000 director's loan payment are fundamentally inconsistent with his own conduct over many years and are pretextual;\n\n2.3.4 The timing of events demonstrates a suspicious pattern suggesting strategic litigation rather than genuine concern about financial misconduct;\n\n2.3.5 The systematic transfer of business control to Ms. Rynette Farrar represents a departure from the collaborative business model that operated successfully for [X] years and is the actual cause of any business disruption.\n\n---",
