## Critical Questions That Expose Peter's Bad Faith

These three strategic questions expose the planning, inconsistent conduct, and coordination underlying Peter's interdict application:

1. **Why did Peter cancel the cards immediately after Daniel provided reports?** (Manufacturing crisis)
2. **Why did Peter need the interdict when he already had absolute trust powers?** (Avoiding accountability)
3. **How could Bantjies provide supporting affidavit against beneficiary if he had trustee powers?** (Breach of duty and perjury)

### Question 1: Why Did Peter Cancel the Cards in Secret the Day After Daniel Gave All Reports to Bantjes?

**Timeline:**
- **Mid-June 2025:** Accountant Daniel Jacobus Bantjes attends for routine tax season work
- **Daniel provides all reports to Bantjes**
- **The next day:** Peter secretly cancels ALL business bank cards (including his own "for the sake thereof")
- **Then:** Peter demands invoices and documentation from Daniel
- **Result:** Services halted, domains down, Daniel unable to provide comprehensive response due to Peter's own actions

**Strategic Significance:**

This timeline demonstrates **planning and inconsistent conduct**:

1. **Peter had the reports** - Daniel provided all documentation to the accountant
2. **Peter created the crisis** - Cancelled cards immediately after receiving reports
3. **Peter created the pretext** - Then demanded documentation he knew Daniel couldn't provide
4. **Peter set the trap** - Created operational chaos, then blamed Daniel for it

**Key Inference:**

If Peter genuinely wanted documentation and transparency, why cancel the cards **immediately after** Daniel provided reports to the accountant? The only logical explanation is that Peter was **manufacturing a pretext** for the interdict.

**Recommended Affidavit Language:**

> "The timing of the Applicant's conduct is revealing and demonstrates premeditation. Daniel provided all reports and documentation to the accountant, Mr. Bantjes, in mid-June 2025. **The very next day**, the Applicant secretly cancelled all business bank cards without notice or discussion. This unilateral action:
>
> - Halted critical business services (domains, subscriptions, etc.)
> - Made it impossible for Daniel to access systems needed to provide further documentation
> - Created operational chaos that disrupted staff and business operations
> - Provided the Applicant with a manufactured 'crisis' to justify this urgent interdict
>
> The Applicant then demanded invoices and documentation from Daniel, knowing full well that his own actions had made a comprehensive response impossible. This is not the conduct of a director seeking transparency—it is the conduct of someone manufacturing a pretext for legal action."

**Evidence Required:**
- Timeline documentation showing:
  - Date Daniel provided reports to Bantjes (JF-BANTJES-DATE)
  - Date Peter cancelled cards (JF-CANCEL-DATE)
  - Correspondence showing no warning or discussion before cancellation (JF-NO-WARN)
  - Evidence of operational disruption caused by cancellations (JF-DISRUPT)

### Question 2: Given Peter's Absolute Unlimited Powers in the Faucitt Family Trust, Why Did He Need the Interdict?

**Trust Structure:**

Peter Faucitt has **absolute control** over the Faucitt Family Trust:
- **Founder** of the trust
- **Trustee** with decision-making authority
- **Beneficiary** with financial interest
- **Daniel:** Beneficiary only, with NO powers (not even the right to respond or to know)

**The Companies:**

The Third to Sixth Respondents (the companies) are presumably owned by or controlled through the Faucitt Family Trust, giving Peter ultimate control.

**Strategic Significance:**

This exposes a **fundamental contradiction** in Peter's case:

1. **Peter already has absolute power** - As founder, trustee, and beneficiary with unlimited authority
2. **Daniel has no power** - Beneficiary only, cannot respond, cannot even access information
3. **Peter could act unilaterally** - Could remove directors, change banking authorities, restructure companies
4. **Peter chose the interdict route instead** - Why?

**Key Inferences:**

There are only a few logical explanations for why Peter sought an urgent interdict despite having absolute trust powers:

**A. The Trust Doesn't Actually Control the Companies**
- If the companies are NOT owned/controlled by the trust, Peter's trust powers are irrelevant
- This would mean Peter is seeking to seize control of companies he doesn't actually control
- This would be a massive overreach and abuse of process

**B. Peter Wanted to Avoid Trust Formalities**
- Acting through the trust would require proper trustee procedures
- An interdict allows Peter to bypass trust governance
- This suggests Peter is avoiding scrutiny or accountability

**C. Peter Wanted a Public Record of "Wrongdoing"**
- The interdict creates a court record of allegations against Jax and Daniel
- This serves Peter's broader agenda of discrediting them
- The interdict is not about financial control—it's about reputation destruction

**D. Peter Wanted to Freeze Assets Before a Major Payout**
- The timing (2 days after settlement agreement) suggests Peter is positioning for a major financial event
- The interdict prevents Jax and Daniel from accessing funds or making decisions
- Peter can then control the distribution of any major payout

**E. Peter Knows His Claims Are Weak**
- If Peter acted through the trust, Jax and Daniel would have internal remedies
- The interdict bypasses internal processes and goes straight to court
- Peter is using the urgency provisions to avoid proper scrutiny

**Most Likely Explanation:**

Peter sought the interdict because:
1. **He wanted to act immediately** without trust formalities
2. **He wanted a public record** of allegations to discredit Jax and Daniel
3. **He wanted to freeze assets** ahead of a major financial event
4. **He knew his claims wouldn't survive proper scrutiny** through trust governance

**Recommended Affidavit Language:**

> "It is instructive to consider what the Applicant did **not** do. As founder, trustee, and beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust, the Applicant has absolute and unlimited powers. Daniel, by contrast, is merely a beneficiary with no powers—not even the right to respond or to know.
>
> If the Applicant genuinely believed that financial misconduct was occurring, he had multiple avenues available through the trust structure:
>
> - He could have convened a trustee meeting to address concerns
> - He could have removed directors through proper trust procedures
> - He could have changed banking authorities through trust resolutions
> - He could have commissioned a forensic investigation through the trust
>
> Instead, the Applicant chose to bypass all internal processes and seek an urgent ex parte interdict, obtaining sweeping relief without notice to the Respondents and without providing them an opportunity to respond.
>
> This choice is revealing. The Applicant did not want scrutiny. He did not want proper process. He wanted immediate control and a public record of allegations. The timing—just 2 days after a settlement agreement—demonstrates that this interdict is not about financial protection. It is about seizing control ahead of a major financial event and creating a false narrative to justify that seizure."

**Evidence Required:**
- Faucitt Family Trust deed showing Peter's powers (JF-TRUST-DEED)
- Trust deed showing Daniel's limited status as beneficiary only (JF-DAN-BENEFICIARY)
- Evidence of Peter's historical exercise of trust powers (JF-TRUST-HISTORY)
- Timeline showing interdict filed 2 days after settlement (JF-TIMELINE-SETTLEMENT)

### Question 3: How Could Bantjies Provide Supporting Affidavit Against Beneficiary Daniel If He Already Had Trustee Powers?

**Bantjies' Appointments:**

Daniel Jacobus Bantjies was appointed to positions of power and responsibility within the Faucitt Family Trust structure:
- **July 2024:** Appointed as trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust
- **October 2024:** Appointed as authority within trust structure
- **August 11, 2025:** Peter has Jacqui sign making him (Peter) "main trustee" (2 days before interdict)

**Bantjies' Fiduciary Duties:**

As trustee, Bantjies owed fiduciary duties to ALL beneficiaries, including Daniel. These duties include:
- Acting in good faith in the interests of all beneficiaries
- Investigating fraud allegations brought by beneficiaries
- Protecting beneficiaries from harm
- Acting impartially between beneficiaries
- Maintaining proper trust governance

**Timeline of Bantjies Ignoring His Duties:**

**June 6, 2025:** Daniel provided comprehensive reports to Bantjies
- Listing of all companies
- Shopify store operations
- Preliminary financial reports
- Full transparency to trustee

**June 10, 2025 (Morning):** Bantjies HIMSELF identified serious fraud
- Documents R10 million missing from bank accounts
- Notes "substantial trading loss" - first in company history
- Questions excessive computer expenses
- Raises SARS investigation concerns
- As trustee, had duty to investigate immediately

**June 10, 2025 (Same Day):** Daniel reported critical information to Bantjies
- Informed trustee about Kayla's murder (August 2023)
- Reported Peter stealing funds after murder
- Detailed R1.8 million owed to Rezonance
- Requested URGENT AUDIT from trustee

**Bantjies' Response:** "I am going away for 2 weeks"

**Bantjies' Failures:**
- Failed to investigate fraud he himself identified
- Failed to investigate murder and theft allegations
- Failed to conduct urgent audit requested by beneficiary
- Failed to protect beneficiary Daniel who reported crimes
- Failed to fulfill any fiduciary duties as trustee

**August 2025:** Bantjies provided supporting affidavit for Peter's ex parte interdict

**What Bantjies Knew by This Time:**
1. R10 million missing (his own finding June 10)
2. Kayla's murder (Daniel's report June 10)
3. Peter's alleged theft after murder (Daniel's report June 10)
4. R1.8 million debt to Rezonance (Daniel's report June 10)
5. Daniel requested urgent audit (June 10)
6. Daniel provided full transparency (June 6)
7. He failed to investigate as trustee despite his duties

**What Bantjies Did NOT Disclose:**
- His own finding of R10 million missing
- Daniel's fraud reports and audit requests
- Murder of business partner
- His dismissal of audit requests
- His failure to investigate as trustee

**What Bantjies DID in Affidavit:**
- Supported Peter's allegations against Daniel
- Provided professional credibility to interdict
- Used his trustee authority to harm beneficiary
- Concealed material facts from court

**Strategic Significance:**

This exposes the most fundamental contradiction in Peter's case:

1. **Bantjies had trustee powers since July 2024** - Could have investigated through trust governance
2. **Daniel sought proper trust oversight** - Reported to trustee Bantjies in June
3. **Bantjies refused to investigate** - Dismissed beneficiary's urgent audit request
4. **Peter bypassed Bantjies' trustee powers** - "Main trustee" appointment 2 days before interdict
5. **Bantjies supported action against beneficiary** - Perjured affidavit without investigation

**Key Inferences:**

**A. Bantjies Breached Fiduciary Duty**
- As trustee, owed duties to beneficiary Daniel
- Supported action against Daniel without investigation
- Failed to protect beneficiary who reported fraud
- Used trustee authority to harm rather than protect

**B. Bantjies Committed Perjury by Omission**
- Concealed his own finding of R10 million missing
- Concealed Daniel's fraud reports and audit requests
- Concealed murder allegations and theft reports
- Concealed his failure to investigate as trustee

**C. Bantjies Was Part of Conspiracy**
- Identified fraud but refused to investigate (June)
- Dismissed audit request from beneficiary (June)
- Provided false affidavit supporting applicant (August)
- Enabled Peter to bypass trust governance

**D. Peter Needed to Bypass Bantjies' Trustee Powers**
- Proper trust investigation would expose Peter's conduct
- Trust governance would give Daniel opportunity to respond
- Impartial trustee should investigate Peter's alleged theft
- Ex parte interdict bypassed all trust processes

**Most Likely Explanation:**

The "main trustee" appointment (Aug 11) and interdict filing (Aug 13) were coordinated to:
1. **Bypass proper trust governance** - Bantjies as trustee would have to investigate impartially
2. **Avoid accountability** - Trust processes require documentation and fairness
3. **Silence the whistleblower** - Punish Daniel for reporting fraud to trustee
4. **Suppress the investigation** - Prevent exposure of Peter's alleged crimes
5. **Create false narrative** - Court record of allegations without investigation

**Recommended Affidavit Language:**

> "The Court should be aware of the peculiar and contradictory role played by Mr. Daniel Jacobus Bantjies in these proceedings. Mr. Bantjies was appointed as a trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust in July 2024 and as an authority in October 2024. As trustee, Mr. Bantjies owed fiduciary duties to all beneficiaries, including Daniel.
>
> On 10 June 2025, Mr. Bantjies himself identified that R10 million was missing from bank accounts. On the same day, Daniel reported to Mr. Bantjies (as trustee) about Kayla's murder, Peter's alleged theft, and requested an urgent audit. Mr. Bantjies' response was: 'I am going away for 2 weeks.'
>
> Despite failing to investigate these serious allegations as required by his fiduciary duties, Mr. Bantjies provided a supporting affidavit for the Applicant's ex parte interdict in August 2025. He did not disclose to the Court:
> - His own finding of R10 million missing
> - Daniel's fraud reports and audit requests to him
> - The murder allegations
> - His failure to investigate as trustee
>
> The Court must ask: How could Mr. Bantjies, as a trustee with fiduciary duties to Daniel, provide a supporting affidavit against Daniel without investigating the fraud allegations Daniel reported to him? This constitutes breach of fiduciary duty, perjury by omission, and conspiracy to suppress investigation.
>
> The fact that the Applicant had me sign a 'main trustee' document on 11 August 2025 (2 days before filing this interdict) demonstrates he was bypassing Bantjies' trustee powers. Why? Because proper trust processes would have required impartial investigation and would have given Daniel opportunity to respond—precisely what the Applicant wanted to avoid."

**Evidence Required:**
- Bantjies' trustee appointment documentation July 2024 (JF-BANTJIES-TRUSTEE-JUL2024)
- Bantjies' authority appointment documentation Oct 2024 (JF-BANTJIES-AUTHORITY-OCT2024)
- "Main trustee" document signed 11 August 2025 (JF-MAIN-TRUSTEE-11AUG2025)
- Daniel's email to Bantjies 6 June 2025 with reports (JF-BANTJIES-REPORTS-06JUN)
- Bantjies' email 10 June 2025 identifying R10M missing (JF-BANTJIES-FRAUD-EMAIL-10JUN)
- Daniel's email to Bantjies 10 June 2025 reporting fraud (JF-DAN-FRAUD-REPORT-10JUN)
- Bantjies' "going on holiday" response (JF-BANTJIES-HOLIDAY-RESPONSE)
- Bantjies' supporting affidavit August 2025 (JF-BANTJIES-AFFIDAVIT-AUG2025)

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Add New Section to Affidavit: "The Applicant's Contradictory Conduct"

This section should systematically expose:
- The suspicious timing of card cancellations (day after Daniel provided reports)
- The manufactured crisis (Peter created the problems he complains about)
- The unnecessary interdict (Peter already has absolute trust powers)
- Bantjies' breach of fiduciary duty and perjury (trustee supporting action against beneficiary)
- The coordinated conspiracy (bypassing Bantjies' trustee powers via "main trustee" appointment)
- The true motive (seizing control ahead of major financial event while suppressing fraud investigation)

### 2. Establish Clear Timeline of Bad Faith and Conspiracy

Create a detailed timeline showing:

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| July 2024 | Bantjies appointed as trustee | Owes fiduciary duties to all beneficiaries including Daniel |
| October 2024 | Bantjies appointed as authority | Additional power and responsibility to oversee trust |
| 6 June 2025 | Daniel provides all reports to Bantjies | Daniel cooperated fully with trustee |
| 7 June 2025 | Peter secretly cancels all business cards | Peter creates crisis day after reports provided |
| 10 June 2025 (AM) | Bantjies identifies R10M missing | Trustee's own finding requires investigation |
| 10 June 2025 (PM) | Daniel reports fraud and murder to Bantjies | Beneficiary seeks trustee protection and urgent audit |
| 10 June 2025 (PM) | Bantjies responds "going on holiday" | Trustee abandons fiduciary duties |
| June-July 2025 | Services halted, domains down | Peter's actions cause operational chaos |
| June-July 2025 | Peter demands documentation from Daniel | Peter demands what his own actions made impossible |
| 11 August 2025 | "Main trustee" appointment signed by Jacqui | Peter bypasses Bantjies' trustee powers |
| 11 August 2025 | Settlement agreement signed | Suspicious timing same day as trustee bypass |
| 13 August 2025 | Peter files urgent ex parte interdict | 2 days after bypassing trustee—coordinated attack |
| August 2025 | Bantjies provides supporting affidavit | Trustee commits perjury against beneficiary he failed to protect |

### 3. Expose the "Why Now?" and "Why This Way?" Questions

The affidavit should explicitly ask:
- Why did Peter cancel cards immediately after Daniel provided reports to Bantjies?
- Why did Bantjies refuse to investigate as trustee when beneficiary reported fraud?
- Why did Peter wait until after the settlement agreement?
- Why did Peter bypass Bantjies' trustee powers via "main trustee" appointment?
- Why did Peter bypass his absolute trust powers?
- Why did Peter seek ex parte relief without notice?
- Why did Bantjies provide supporting affidavit without investigating?
- Why did Peter manufacture a crisis through card cancellations?

The only logical answer: **This is a coordinated, premeditated conspiracy designed to seize control ahead of a major financial event while suppressing investigation of Peter's crimes.**

### 4. Connect to Material Non-Disclosure

Peter's and Bantjies' failures to disclose material facts in the ex parte application constitute **material non-disclosures**:

**Peter Failed to Disclose:**
- His absolute trust powers (already had control)
- His ability to act through trust governance (interdict unnecessary)
- Settlement signed same day as "main trustee" appointment
- His cancellation of cards that created the crisis he complained about

**Bantjies Failed to Disclose:**
- His role as trustee with fiduciary duties to Daniel
- His own finding of R10 million missing (10 June 2025)
- Daniel's fraud reports and audit requests to him (6 & 10 June 2025)
- Murder allegations reported by Daniel
- His dismissal of audit requests ("going on holiday")
- His failure to investigate as required by fiduciary duties

**Combined Effect:**
- The court was not told Peter already had absolute control through trust
- The court was not told Bantjies was trustee who should have investigated
- The court was not told Daniel sought proper trust oversight but was ignored
- The court was not told Bantjies identified fraud himself but refused to investigate
- The court was misled into granting relief that bypassed proper trust governance
- The court was deceived about the true nature of the dispute

This constitutes **perjury by omission** and provides grounds for **setting aside the interim order and removing Bantjies as trustee for breach of fiduciary duty**.

---

## Conclusion

These three questions expose the fundamental weakness in Peter's case: **he manufactured a crisis to justify an unnecessary interdict, while bypassing proper trust governance that would have exposed his own conduct**.

**Question 1:** Why did Peter cancel cards immediately after Daniel provided reports to the accountant?  
**Answer:** To manufacture a crisis and prevent Daniel from providing comprehensive documentation.

**Question 2:** Why did Peter need an interdict when he already had absolute trust powers?  
**Answer:** To avoid trust formalities, create a public record of allegations, and seize control without accountability.

**Question 3:** How could Bantjies provide supporting affidavit against beneficiary Daniel if he already had trustee powers?  
**Answer:** Because Bantjies breached his fiduciary duties, committed perjury by omission, and was part of a conspiracy to suppress Daniel's fraud reports and avoid proper investigation.

The timing, the conduct, and the choice of legal mechanism all point to premeditation, bad faith, and coordinated conspiracy.

By incorporating this analysis into the affidavit, Jax can transform the narrative from defensive ("we didn't do anything wrong") to offensive ("Peter, Bantjies, and their attorneys orchestrated this entire crisis to seize control and suppress investigation of Peter's crimes").

**Next Step:** Draft specific paragraphs for the affidavit incorporating this analysis and integrate with existing Section 13B.
