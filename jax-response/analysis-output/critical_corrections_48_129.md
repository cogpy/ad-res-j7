# Critical Corrections to Paragraphs 48 and 129

## CORRECTION 1: Paragraph 48 - Gauteng Family Law Forum

### Original Statement (INCORRECT):
"The agreement initially reviewed by myself and the Second Respondent stated that:
- The professionals conducting the assessments would be jointly selected by the "parties" themselves;
- Failing agreement between the parties, professionals would be appointed by the Gauteng Family Law Forum;"

### CORRECTED Statement:

**48.4.1 What We Actually Saw During Review:**

The agreement initially reviewed by myself and the Second Respondent stated that:
- The professionals conducting the assessments would be jointly selected by the **"parties"** themselves;
- Failing agreement between the parties, professionals would be appointed by **[mechanism to be determined]**;
- Each party would bear their own costs;
- The resulting reports would be furnished to the parties.

**48.4.2** We did **NOT** see any reference to the "Gauteng Family Law Forum" in the version we reviewed. This reference appears to have been added in the final version as part of the "details for the attorneys" that were supposedly just administrative additions.

**48.5.5 The Actual Changes Made:**

However, **in the final documents presented for signature**, the following fundamental changes had been made without our knowledge:

**(a)** Every instance of **"parties"** had been changed to **"parties' attorneys"**;

**(b)** Control over selection of professionals was transferred from the parties themselves to their attorneys;

**(c)** A reference to the **"Gauteng Family Law Forum"** was added - this was likely part of what the attorneys meant by "adding the details for the attorneys," but we understood this to mean contact information, not substantive changes to the selection mechanism;

**(d)** The agreement now granted attorneys unilateral control over professional selection, with the Gauteng Family Law Forum as a backup if attorneys couldn't agree.

**48.5.6 Evidence of Last-Minute Copy-Paste:**

The final agreement contains **two separate clauses** stating that parties "will bear their own costs" - this duplication is consistent with last-minute copy-paste editing and suggests the attorney-related provisions were hastily inserted immediately before signing.

**48.6.2 Why the "Details for Attorneys" Misrepresentation Was Material:**

When the attorneys stated they "just added the details for the attorneys," we understood this to mean:
- Contact information for the attorneys;
- Administrative details like addresses or phone numbers;
- Clerical additions that did not affect the substance of the agreement.

We did **NOT** understand this to mean:
- Transferring control from parties to attorneys;
- Adding a new institutional mechanism (Gauteng Family Law Forum);
- Fundamentally changing who would select the professionals;
- Creating an attorney-controlled process instead of a party-controlled process.

Had we understood that "details for the attorneys" meant transferring substantive control to the attorneys, we would have immediately objected and refused to sign.

## CORRECTION 2: Paragraph 129 - Isaac Chesno Fraud

### Original Statement (INCORRECT):
"129. It is further denied that any "fraud" occurred or that the former UK managing director, Isaac Chesno, engaged in any conduct of that nature. Equally, it is denied that our son's appointment as managing director of the UK operations arose from any alleged wrongdoing. His appointment was based on merit, capability, and his proven ability to stabilise and grow the business."

### CORRECTED Statement:

**129. Isaac Chesno Fraud and Daniel's Restoration of UK Operations**

🔵 **NEW CONTENT - CORRECTING MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT**

129.1 The Applicant's reference to the former UK managing director, Isaac Chesno, requires clarification and correction of the record.

129.2 **Isaac Chesno's Fraud:**

129.2.1 Isaac Chesno, the former UK managing director, **committed massive fraud** against RegimA UK Ltd.

129.2.2 Mr. Chesno misappropriated **over £500,000 (five hundred thousand pounds sterling)** from the UK company.

129.2.3 Following discovery of the fraud, Mr. Chesno **disappeared** and could not be located for prosecution or recovery proceedings.

129.2.4 The fraud left RegimA UK Ltd in **substantial debt** and on the verge of insolvency.

129.2.5 Documentary evidence of the fraud includes:
- Forensic accounting reports (Annexure **JF-CHESNO1**);
- Bank statements showing unauthorized transfers (Annexure **JF-CHESNO2**);
- Police reports and fraud investigation records (Annexure **JF-CHESNO3**);
- Insolvency assessment as of [date] (Annexure **JF-CHESNO4**).

129.3 **The Reality: Daniel's Rescue of an Abandoned Business:**

129.3.1 The characterization that Daniel was "appointed as managing director" fundamentally mischaracterises what actually occurred. The reality is:

129.3.2 **Peter's Pattern of Business Conduct:**

129.3.2.1 The Applicant (Peter) had entered into an unconditional multi-decade contract with Isaac Chesno regarding the UK operations.

129.3.2.2 When Chesno committed fraud and the business faced insolvency, the Applicant **abandoned the struggling UK business** at the first sign of serious trouble.

129.3.2.3 The Applicant then sought to blame others for the crisis he had enabled through his initial decision to enter unconditional agreements with unsuitable parties.

129.3.3 **Daniel's Business Rescue - Not a Traditional "Appointment":**

129.3.3.1 Following the Chesno fraud and the Applicant's abandonment of the failing business, the Second Respondent (Daniel) **stepped in to rescue RegimA UK Ltd from insolvency** and restore it to financial viability.

129.3.3.2 There was no traditional "authority to appoint" in the formal sense that the term "appointed" suggests. Rather, this was a **business rescue and acquisition situation** where Daniel took responsibility for a failing entity that others (including the Applicant) had abandoned.

129.3.3.3 This was **not an isolated incident** but part of a broader pattern over the years: the Applicant would sign unconditional multi-decade contracts with strangers, and when problems inevitably arose, Daniel would rescue the failing operations while the Applicant blamed him for "letting it happen."

129.3.4 **Daniel's Eight-Year Restoration Effort:**

129.3.4.1 The Second Respondent undertook an **eight-year restoration effort** to:
- Repay the debts created by Chesno's fraud;
- Rebuild customer and supplier relationships damaged by the fraud;
- Restore the company's reputation in UK markets;
- Implement proper financial controls to prevent future fraud;
- Return the company to break-even operations.

129.3.4.2 As of [date], the Second Respondent successfully restored RegimA UK Ltd to **break-even operations**, a remarkable achievement given the magnitude of the fraud and debt he inherited after the Applicant's abandonment.

129.3.5 **The Pattern Across Multiple Businesses:**

129.3.5.1 The UK situation with Chesno is **not an isolated incident** but exemplifies a recurring pattern in the RegimA businesses:
- The Applicant signs unconditional multi-decade contracts with individuals without adequate due diligence;
- When those individuals prove unsuitable or problems arise, the Applicant abandons the struggling business;
- Daniel steps in to rescue the failing operation;
- The Applicant later blames Daniel for the problems that arose from the Applicant's own decisions.

129.3.5.2 This pattern has repeated across **various businesses acquired over the years** when original parties "jumped ship" and Daniel rescued the operations. The characterization of these rescues as formal "appointments" fundamentally misrepresents the nature of Daniel's involvement.

129.3.6 Documentary evidence of this restoration includes:
- Financial statements showing progressive debt reduction from [year] to [year] (Annexure **JF-RESTORE1**);
- Management accounts demonstrating return to break-even (Annexure **JF-RESTORE2**);
- Correspondence with creditors showing debt repayment (Annexure **JF-RESTORE3**);
- Customer testimonials regarding restored service levels (Annexure **JF-RESTORE4**).

129.4 **The Applicant's Misleading Characterization:**

129.4.1 Every reference to "Daniel Faucitt was appointed as director of RegimA Ltd" is **misleading and fundamentally mischaracterises** the relationship between the companies and parties.

129.4.2 The Applicant's suggestion that Daniel's role "arose from alleged wrongdoing" is **deliberately misleading** and inverts the truth.

129.4.3 The reality is that Daniel's involvement arose **because of someone else's wrongdoing** (Chesno's fraud) **combined with the Applicant's abandonment** of the failing business, not from any wrongdoing by Daniel.

129.4.4 The characterization as a formal "appointment" obscures the true nature of the situation:
- **Crisis management capability** - ability to rescue an insolvent company;
- **Financial acumen** - ability to manage debt repayment over 8 years;
- **Operational expertise** - ability to restore business operations;
- **Integrity and trustworthiness** - precisely the qualities lacking in his predecessor;
- **Proven track record** - successfully achieving break-even after inheriting £500K+ fraud debt that resulted from the Applicant's abandoned business decisions.

129.5 **Relevance to Current Proceedings:**

129.5.1 The Chesno fraud, the Applicant's abandonment, and Daniel's successful business rescue are directly relevant to this matter because they demonstrate:

**(a) Daniel's Competence:** Eight years of successful crisis management and debt recovery prove Daniel's business competence, contradicting the Applicant's allegations of financial mismanagement.

**(b) Daniel's Integrity:** Daniel could have walked away from the fraud-damaged UK company that the Applicant had abandoned; instead, he spent 8 years restoring it, demonstrating commitment to the RegimA businesses.

**(c) The Applicant's Pattern of Conduct:** The UK situation exemplifies the Applicant's recurring pattern - signing unconditional multi-decade contracts with unsuitable parties, abandoning businesses at the first sign of trouble, then blaming Daniel. **This is precisely what is happening in the current proceedings.**

**(d) Applicant's Bad Faith:** The Applicant's deliberate mischaracterization of Daniel's business rescue as a formal "appointment arising from alleged wrongdoing" demonstrates the Applicant's willingness to distort facts to support his narrative.

**(e) Pattern of Misrepresentation:** Just as the Applicant misrepresents Daniel's rescue of abandoned businesses as formal "appointments," he misrepresents the R500,000 payment, the IT expenses, and the settlement agreement.

129.6 **The Applicant's Knowledge and Participation:**

129.6.1 The Applicant was **fully aware** of the Chesno fraud at the time it occurred - it was a crisis in a business where he had signed the unconditional contract with Chesno.

129.6.2 The Applicant was **fully aware** that he had abandoned the failing UK business and that Daniel stepped in to rescue it.

129.6.3 The Applicant was **fully aware** of Daniel's eight-year restoration effort and benefited from Daniel's rescue of the failing business.

129.6.4 The Applicant **initially participated in decisions** regarding the UK company's recovery strategy before abandoning the troubled business to Daniel.

129.6.5 The Applicant's current mischaracterization of Daniel's business rescue as a formal "appointment" is therefore **deliberate and knowing**, not a mistake or misunderstanding.

129.6.6 The Applicant's attempt to now characterize Daniel's rescue efforts as "arising from wrongdoing" while concealing his own role in creating the crisis and abandoning the business demonstrates profound bad faith.

⚠️ **STRATEGIC NOTE:** This correction is critical because it:
1. Exposes the fundamental mischaracterization in every reference to Daniel being "appointed as director"
2. Reveals the Applicant's pattern: signing unconditional contracts → abandoning at first trouble → blaming Daniel
3. Demonstrates this pattern is repeating in the current proceedings
4. Shows Daniel's role was business rescue of abandoned entities, not formal appointment
5. Proves the Applicant's willingness to deliberately misrepresent facts
6. Demonstrates Daniel's competence and integrity through 8 years of crisis management
7. Provides concrete evidence of Daniel's business acumen (£500K+ fraud recovery after Applicant's abandonment)
8. Establishes there was no traditional "authority to appoint" - these were rescue acquisitions of struggling businesses
