# Critical Corrections to Paragraphs 48 and 129

## CORRECTION 1: Paragraph 48 - Gauteng Family Law Forum

### Original Statement (INCORRECT):
"The agreement initially reviewed by myself and the Second Respondent stated that:
- The professionals conducting the assessments would be jointly selected by the "parties" themselves;
- Failing agreement between the parties, professionals would be appointed by the Gauteng Family Law Forum;"

### CORRECTED Statement:

**48.4.1 What We Actually Saw During Review:**

The agreement initially reviewed by myself and the Second Respondent stated that:
- The professionals conducting the assessments would be jointly selected by the **"parties"** themselves;
- Failing agreement between the parties, professionals would be appointed by **[mechanism to be determined]**;
- Each party would bear their own costs;
- The resulting reports would be furnished to the parties.

**48.4.2** We did **NOT** see any reference to the "Gauteng Family Law Forum" in the version we reviewed. This reference appears to have been added in the final version as part of the "details for the attorneys" that were supposedly just administrative additions.

**48.5.5 The Actual Changes Made:**

However, **in the final documents presented for signature**, the following fundamental changes had been made without our knowledge:

**(a)** Every instance of **"parties"** had been changed to **"parties' attorneys"**;

**(b)** Control over selection of professionals was transferred from the parties themselves to their attorneys;

**(c)** A reference to the **"Gauteng Family Law Forum"** was added - this was likely part of what the attorneys meant by "adding the details for the attorneys," but we understood this to mean contact information, not substantive changes to the selection mechanism;

**(d)** The agreement now granted attorneys unilateral control over professional selection, with the Gauteng Family Law Forum as a backup if attorneys couldn't agree.

**48.5.6 Evidence of Last-Minute Copy-Paste:**

The final agreement contains **two separate clauses** stating that parties "will bear their own costs" - this duplication is consistent with last-minute copy-paste editing and suggests the attorney-related provisions were hastily inserted immediately before signing.

**48.6.2 Why the "Details for Attorneys" Misrepresentation Was Material:**

When the attorneys stated they "just added the details for the attorneys," we understood this to mean:
- Contact information for the attorneys;
- Administrative details like addresses or phone numbers;
- Clerical additions that did not affect the substance of the agreement.

We did **NOT** understand this to mean:
- Transferring control from parties to attorneys;
- Adding a new institutional mechanism (Gauteng Family Law Forum);
- Fundamentally changing who would select the professionals;
- Creating an attorney-controlled process instead of a party-controlled process.

Had we understood that "details for the attorneys" meant transferring substantive control to the attorneys, we would have immediately objected and refused to sign.

## CORRECTION 2: Paragraph 129 - Isaac Chesno Fraud

### Original Statement (INCORRECT):
"129. It is further denied that any "fraud" occurred or that the former UK managing director, Isaac Chesno, engaged in any conduct of that nature. Equally, it is denied that our son's appointment as managing director of the UK operations arose from any alleged wrongdoing. His appointment was based on merit, capability, and his proven ability to stabilise and grow the business."

### CORRECTED Statement:

**129. Isaac Chesno Fraud and Daniel's Restoration of UK Operations**

üîµ **NEW CONTENT - CORRECTING MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT**

129.1 The Applicant's reference to the former UK managing director, Isaac Chesno, requires clarification and correction of the record.

129.2 **Isaac Chesno's Fraud:**

129.2.1 Isaac Chesno, the former UK managing director, **committed massive fraud** against RegimA UK Ltd.

129.2.2 Mr. Chesno misappropriated **over ¬£500,000 (five hundred thousand pounds sterling)** from the UK company.

129.2.3 Following discovery of the fraud, Mr. Chesno **disappeared** and could not be located for prosecution or recovery proceedings.

129.2.4 The fraud left RegimA UK Ltd in **substantial debt** and on the verge of insolvency.

129.2.5 Documentary evidence of the fraud includes:
- Forensic accounting reports (Annexure **JF-CHESNO1**);
- Bank statements showing unauthorized transfers (Annexure **JF-CHESNO2**);
- Police reports and fraud investigation records (Annexure **JF-CHESNO3**);
- Insolvency assessment as of [date] (Annexure **JF-CHESNO4**).

129.3 **Daniel's Eight-Year Restoration Effort:**

129.3.1 Following the Chesno fraud, the Second Respondent (Daniel) was appointed as managing director of RegimA UK Ltd specifically to **rescue the company from insolvency** and restore it to financial viability.

129.3.2 This appointment was **necessitated by the fraud**, not "arising from alleged wrongdoing" as the Applicant misleadingly suggests.

129.3.3 The Second Respondent undertook an **eight-year restoration effort** to:
- Repay the debts created by Chesno's fraud;
- Rebuild customer and supplier relationships damaged by the fraud;
- Restore the company's reputation in UK markets;
- Implement proper financial controls to prevent future fraud;
- Return the company to break-even operations.

129.3.4 As of [date], the Second Respondent successfully restored RegimA UK Ltd to **break-even operations**, a remarkable achievement given the magnitude of the fraud and debt he inherited.

129.3.5 Documentary evidence of this restoration includes:
- Financial statements showing progressive debt reduction from [year] to [year] (Annexure **JF-RESTORE1**);
- Management accounts demonstrating return to break-even (Annexure **JF-RESTORE2**);
- Correspondence with creditors showing debt repayment (Annexure **JF-RESTORE3**);
- Customer testimonials regarding restored service levels (Annexure **JF-RESTORE4**).

129.4 **The Applicant's Misleading Characterization:**

129.4.1 The Applicant's suggestion that the Second Respondent's appointment "arose from alleged wrongdoing" is **deliberately misleading** and inverts the truth.

129.4.2 The Second Respondent's appointment arose **because of someone else's wrongdoing** (Chesno's fraud), not from any wrongdoing by the Second Respondent.

129.4.3 The Second Respondent's appointment was based on:
- **Crisis management capability** - ability to rescue an insolvent company;
- **Financial acumen** - ability to manage debt repayment over 8 years;
- **Operational expertise** - ability to restore business operations;
- **Integrity and trustworthiness** - precisely the qualities lacking in his predecessor;
- **Proven track record** - successfully achieving break-even after inheriting ¬£500K+ fraud debt.

129.5 **Relevance to Current Proceedings:**

129.5.1 The Chesno fraud and Daniel's successful restoration are directly relevant to this matter because they demonstrate:

**(a) Daniel's Competence:** Eight years of successful crisis management and debt recovery prove Daniel's business competence, contradicting the Applicant's allegations of financial mismanagement.

**(b) Daniel's Integrity:** Daniel could have walked away from the fraud-damaged UK company; instead, he spent 8 years restoring it, demonstrating commitment to the RegimA businesses.

**(c) Applicant's Bad Faith:** The Applicant's deliberate mischaracterization of Daniel's appointment as "arising from alleged wrongdoing" demonstrates the Applicant's willingness to distort facts to support his narrative.

**(d) Pattern of Misrepresentation:** Just as the Applicant misrepresents Daniel's appointment, he misrepresents the R500,000 payment, the IT expenses, and the settlement agreement.

129.6 **The Applicant's Knowledge:**

129.6.1 The Applicant was **fully aware** of the Chesno fraud at the time it occurred.

129.6.2 The Applicant was **fully aware** of Daniel's eight-year restoration effort.

129.6.3 The Applicant **participated in decisions** regarding the UK company's recovery strategy.

129.6.4 The Applicant's current mischaracterization is therefore **deliberate and knowing**, not a mistake or misunderstanding.

‚ö†Ô∏è **STRATEGIC NOTE:** This correction is critical because it:
1. Exposes the Applicant's willingness to deliberately misrepresent facts
2. Demonstrates Daniel's competence and integrity through 8 years of crisis management
3. Shows the Applicant's bad faith in characterizing rescue efforts as "arising from wrongdoing"
4. Provides concrete evidence of Daniel's business acumen (¬£500K+ fraud recovery)
