## Key Arguments (30-Second Version)

**For Court:**
> "Mr. Bantjies was trustee with fiduciary duties to Daniel. When Daniel reported fraud in June 2025, Bantjies dismissed the urgent audit request. Two months later, Bantjies provided a supporting affidavit against Daniel without investigating and without disclosing to the Court that he himself had identified R10 million missing. This is breach of fiduciary duty and perjury by omission."

**For Narrative:**
> "Daniel sought proper trust oversight by reporting fraud to trustee Bantjies. Instead of investigating, Bantjies went on holiday. Then Peter bypassed Bantjies by having Jacqui sign a 'main trustee' document on August 11. Two days later, Peter filed this interdict, and Bantjies provided a false affidavit supporting it. This is a coordinated conspiracy to suppress investigation."

## Material Non-Disclosures Checklist

Court was NOT told:

**By Peter:**
- [ ] His absolute trust powers (interdict unnecessary)
- [ ] Settlement 2 days before interdict
- [ ] His card cancellations created the crisis
- [ ] He bypassed Bantjies via "main trustee" appointment

**By Bantjies:**
- [ ] His role as trustee with duties to Daniel
- [ ] His own finding of R10M missing (June 10)
- [ ] Daniel's fraud reports to him (June 6 & 10)
- [ ] Murder allegations reported to him
- [ ] His dismissal of audit requests
- [ ] His failure to investigate as required

## Relief to Request

1. ‚úÖ Set aside interim order (material non-disclosure)
2. ‚úÖ Remove Bantjies as trustee (breach of fiduciary duty)
3. ‚úÖ Costs against Bantjies personally
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider: Referral for criminal prosecution (perjury)
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider: Independent trustee appointment

## One-Minute Verbal Summary

*"There's a fundamental problem with Bantjies' affidavit. He was appointed as trustee in July 2024, which means he owed fiduciary duties to Daniel. In June 2025, Bantjies himself identified R10 million missing. On the same day, Daniel reported to Bantjies about fraud and murder, and requested an urgent audit. Bantjies' response? 'I'm going on holiday for 2 weeks.'*

*Two months later, Bantjies provides a supporting affidavit for Peter's interdict application. He doesn't tell the court about his role as trustee. He doesn't tell the court he found R10 million missing. He doesn't tell the court Daniel reported fraud to him. He doesn't tell the court he refused to investigate.*

*The timing is revealing. On August 11, Peter had Jacqui sign making him 'main trustee'‚Äîbypassing Bantjies. Two days later, Peter files the interdict. This is a coordinated effort to avoid proper trust investigation that would have exposed Peter's conduct rather than Daniel's.*

*This is breach of fiduciary duty, perjury by omission, and grounds for setting aside the interim order and removing Bantjies as trustee."*
