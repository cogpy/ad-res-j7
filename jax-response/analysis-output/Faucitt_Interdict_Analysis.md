# Faucitt Interdict: Comprehensive Analysis and Reference Index

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the legal arguments in the Faucitt interdict case and a reference index for the 'AD PARAGRAPH' blocks in the answering affidavit.

## Legal Argument Analysis

This section analyzes the key legal arguments presented in Peter Faucitt's founding affidavit, identifying their strengths and weaknesses.

### Unexplained IT Expenses

**Summary:** Peter alleges that Daniel approved numerous unexplained IT-related expenses totaling R6,738,007.47 (2024) and R2,116,159.47 (2025), with no invoices or documentation.

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|
| Large monetary amounts that require explanation (R8.8M+ over two years) | No evidence that invoices were actually requested in proper format or timeframe |
| Accountant (Daniel Bantjes) identified discrepancies during routine tax work | Unilateral card cancellation by Peter prevented normal business operations |
| International payments approaching SARB limits (80% of annual quota) | No evidence that Daniel refused to provide documentation - only that Peter deemed it insufficient |
| Specific figures and dates provided | Peter admits "a few" invoices were provided, suggesting some documentation exists |
| Annexures PF9 and PF10 contain transaction records | IT expenses for international business operations may be legitimate and substantial |
|  | No forensic analysis conducted before filing - only accountant observations |
|  | Peter characterizes normal business expenses as "unexplained" without proper investigation |
|  | Timing suspicious: raised during tax season when comprehensive documentation review is normal |

**Counter-Evidence Available:**
- Bank statements showing clear transaction descriptions
- Invoices and contracts for legitimate IT services
- Evidence that Daniel provided requested documentation
- Evidence that Peter restricted access to systems containing documentation
- Evidence that RegimA operates internationally and requires substantial IT infrastructure


### R500,000 Unauthorized Birthday Gift

**Summary:** Peter alleges Jacqueline transferred R500,000 to Daniel as an unauthorized "birthday gift" not constituting legitimate business expense.

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|
| Specific amount and date (R500,000 on or about 16 July 2025) | No evidence of what bank reference or description was used |
| Peter claims he did not authorize the payment | Ignores established practice of director loan accounts |
| Characterized as personal gift rather than business expense | Peter admits Jacqueline has no other income sources - so payment must be from director loan account |
| Separate from Daniel's regular remuneration | No evidence Peter objected at the time or requested reversal |
|  | Timing: Peter only raises this after filing interdict, suggesting pretext |
|  | Directors of close corporations routinely draw funds via loan accounts |
|  | No board resolution requirement established for such transactions in these entities |
|  | Peter likely made similar withdrawals himself without formal authorization |

**Counter-Evidence Available:**
- Bank statement showing proper reference (e.g., "Director loan - Daniel")
- Evidence of Daniel's existing director loan account with credit balance
- Evidence that all directors regularly draw funds via loan accounts
- Evidence that Peter himself has drawn similar amounts without board resolutions
- Historical practice of informal director loan transactions
- Accounting records showing proper allocation to director loan account


### Breach of Fiduciary Duties

**Summary:** Peter alleges Jacqueline and Daniel breached fiduciary duties under Companies Act s162 and Close Corporations Act s42, justifying delinquency declaration.

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|
| Correctly cites relevant statutory provisions | No evidence of actual breach - only allegations of "unexplained" expenses |
| Fiduciary duty framework is well-established in law | No evidence of personal benefit or conflict of interest |
| Directors/members do owe duties to corporations | No evidence of dishonesty or intentional wrongdoing |
| Delinquency provisions exist for serious misconduct | Delinquency is extreme remedy requiring gross misconduct or willful breach |
|  | Courts require clear and convincing evidence for delinquency declarations |
|  | Peter participated in same informal business model for years without objection |
|  | Peter's own conduct (unilateral card cancellation, system lockouts) may breach duties |
|  | No evidence of harm to corporations - businesses continue operating profitably |
|  | Timing suggests ulterior motive rather than genuine concern for corporate welfare |

**Counter-Evidence Available:**
- Evidence that all transactions were legitimate business expenses
- Evidence that Jacqueline and Daniel acted transparently and in good faith
- Evidence of Peter's participation in informal business model
- Evidence that Peter's actions (not respondents') are causing business disruption
- Financial records showing corporations remain profitable and solvent
- Evidence that Peter's allegations are pretextual


### Urgency Justifying Ex Parte Interdict

**Summary:** Peter claims urgent interim relief necessary to prevent ongoing financial misconduct and protect corporate assets.

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|
| Ex parte interdict was granted by court | No evidence of imminent irreparable harm |
| Alleged ongoing access to bank accounts | Issues allegedly ongoing since June 2025 - Peter waited months before filing |
| Alleged risk of continued unauthorized transactions | Peter cancelled cards in June but filed interdict in August - what changed? |
| International payments approaching regulatory limits | No evidence of asset dissipation or flight risk |
|  | Jacqueline and Daniel are family members with established business roles |
|  | Corporations continue operating normally |
|  | Peter failed to disclose material facts in ex parte application |
|  | Failed to disclose: Jacqueline's role as Responsible Person in 37 jurisdictions |
|  | Failed to disclose: settlement agreement signed 8 days before interdict |
|  | Failed to disclose: upcoming investment payout in 9 months |
|  | Failed to disclose: Peter's systematic transfer of control to Rynette Farrar |
|  | Failed to disclose: Peter's own unilateral actions (card cancellations, system lockouts) |
|  | Timing highly suspicious - suggests strategic litigation rather than genuine urgency |

**Counter-Evidence Available:**
- Evidence of material non-disclosure in ex parte application
- Timeline showing lack of genuine urgency
- Evidence of Peter's strategic timing (post-settlement, pre-payout)
- Evidence of business disruption caused by interdict (Responsible Person compliance crisis)
- Evidence that Peter's actions, not respondents', created any alleged urgency


### Need for Forensic Investigation and Expert Appointment

**Summary:** Peter seeks to appoint forensic accountant and experts to investigate alleged financial misconduct.

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|
| Forensic investigation can provide clarity on disputed transactions | Peter already has access to all financial records as director |
| Expert analysis may be appropriate for complex financial matters | Peter has accountant (Daniel Bantjes) who can review records |
| Court authorized such investigation in interim order | No preliminary investigation conducted before filing |
|  | Request appears designed to create fishing expedition |
|  | Forensic investigation at corporate expense punishes corporations for alleged director misconduct |
|  | Peter seeks to exclude Jacqueline and Daniel from business while investigation proceeds |
|  | Investigation may be pretext for gaining total control of businesses |
|  | No specific allegations of fraud or criminal conduct requiring forensic analysis |
|  | Normal accounting review would suffice if genuine concern about documentation |

**Counter-Evidence Available:**
- Evidence that Peter has full access to all financial records
- Evidence that normal accounting processes can address any documentation questions
- Evidence that "investigation" is pretext for business takeover
- Evidence that Peter transferred control to Rynette Farrar, not independent expert


### Material Non-Disclosures

The following material facts were not disclosed by Peter Faucitt in his ex parte application:

| Fact | Materiality | Why It's Material |
|---|---|---|
| Jacqueline's Role as Responsible Person | CRITICAL - Interdict prevents Jacqueline from performing non-delegable legal duties, creating immediate compliance crisis in 37 jurisdictions. Potential regulatory penalties, product recalls, loss of market access, and criminal liability. | Court would likely have refused interdict or crafted different relief if aware that preventing Jacqueline's business access creates international regulatory violations. |
| Settlement Agreement Signed 8 Days Before Interdict | HIGH - Demonstrates Peter's bad faith and suggests interdict is strategic litigation to gain leverage, not genuine response to urgent financial misconduct. | Pattern of behavior: settlement agreement as "Trojan horse" followed by immediate litigation. Court would question Peter's bona fides and urgency claims. |
| Upcoming Investment Payout in 9 Months | HIGH - Suggests financial motive for Peter to gain control of businesses before payout. Timing is suspicious. | Court would consider whether interdict is motivated by desire to control assets before major financial event rather than genuine concern about misconduct. |
| Peter's Systematic Transfer of Control to Rynette Farrar | HIGH - Undermines Peter's claims about financial controls and fiduciary concerns. If Peter genuinely worried about unauthorized transactions, why give total control to non-director employee? | Demonstrates Peter's allegations are pretextual. His actions (empowering Rynette, excluding directors) are inconsistent with stated concerns about financial oversight. |
| Peter's Own Unilateral Actions Creating Business Disruption | MEDIUM-HIGH - Peter's own conduct caused business disruptions he now attributes to respondents. Court entitled to know full context. | Peter presents himself as protecting businesses from reckless directors, but evidence shows his unilateral actions disrupted operations. Material to assessment of who is acting improperly. |
| Historical Collaborative Business Model | MEDIUM - Peter now characterizes as "misconduct" the same informal practices he participated in for years. Material to assessment of whether conduct is actually improper. | Court would consider whether Peter is genuinely concerned about governance or simply weaponizing previously acceptable practices for strategic advantage. |
| Director Loan Account Structure | MEDIUM - Peter characterizes R500,000 payment as unauthorized "gift" but fails to disclose it was processed through established director loan account mechanism. | Material to assessment of whether R500,000 payment was improper or simply routine director loan transaction. |
