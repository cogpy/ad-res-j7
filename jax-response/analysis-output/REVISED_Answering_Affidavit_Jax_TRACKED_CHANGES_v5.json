      "content": "üîµ **NEW CONTENT - STRATEGIC FRAMING**\n\n2.1 The purpose of this affidavit is to respond to the Applicant's founding affidavit and to place before this Honourable Court material facts that were not disclosed in the ex parte application that resulted in the interdict granted on 19 August 2025.\n\n2.2 **Material Non-Disclosure in Ex Parte Application:**\n\n2.2.1 The Applicant obtained the ex parte interdict by failing to make full and frank disclosure of material facts that would have caused this Honourable Court to refuse the relief sought or to craft substantially different relief.\n\n2.2.2 The duty of utmost good faith (*uberrima fides*) in ex parte applications requires an applicant to disclose all material facts, including those that may be adverse to the application.\n\n2.2.3 The Applicant failed to disclose the following material facts:\n\n**(a) My Role as Legally Designated Responsible Person:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that I serve as the legally designated \"Responsible Person\" for RegimA products in 37 international jurisdictions under EU Regulation 1223/2009 and equivalent laws, and that the interdict would prevent me from performing non-delegable legal duties, creating immediate regulatory non-compliance and exposing the businesses to substantial penalties, product recalls, and loss of market access.\n\n**(b) Settlement Agreement Signed 8 Days Before Interdict:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that he and I signed a settlement agreement on or about 11 August 2025, and that he filed this interdict application merely 2 days later (13 August 2025), suggesting the interdict is part of a coordinated strategy rather than a genuine response to urgent financial misconduct.\n\n**(c) Upcoming Investment Payout in 9 Months:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that a significant investment payout is due to mature in approximately May 2026 (9 months from the August 2025 interdict), suggesting a financial motive for gaining control of the businesses before this major financial event.\n\n**(d) Applicant's Transfer of Control to Non-Director Bookkeeper:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that he has systematically granted Ms. Rynette Farrar (a non-director bookkeeper) unprecedented access and authority, including: access to all bank accounts, all of his passwords and login credentials, signatory authority on multiple accounts, and ability to transact unilaterally without director approval.\n\n**(e) Applicant's Own Unilateral Actions Causing Business Disruption:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that he unilaterally cancelled all business cards in June 2025, restricted director access to systems, characterized director oversight as \"interference\", and excluded the First and Second Respondents from decision-making.\n\n**(f) Historical Collaborative Business Model:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that the RegimA businesses operated for [X] years with an informal, trust-based, collaborative model in which directors drew from loan accounts without formal board resolutions, and that the Applicant participated in and benefited from this model throughout its history.\n\n**(g) Director Loan Account Structure:**\n\nThe Applicant failed to disclose that directors maintain loan accounts with credit balances of several million rand, that companies owe directors substantial sums at all times, and that the Applicant himself has received similar payments without formal board resolutions on numerous occasions.\n\n2.2.4 Had this Honourable Court been aware of these material facts, the Court would likely have:\n- Refused to grant the ex parte interdict; or\n- Crafted substantially different relief that preserved my ability to perform non-delegable legal duties and that did not reward the Applicant's own misconduct.\n\n2.3 I will demonstrate in this affidavit that:\n\n2.3.1 The Applicant's material non-disclosures undermine the foundation of the ex parte interdict;\n\n2.3.2 The interdict creates immediate and serious compliance risks for the RegimA businesses in 37 international jurisdictions;\n\n2.3.3 The Applicant's objections to business expenses and the R500,000 director's loan payment are fundamentally inconsistent with his own conduct over many years and are pretextual;\n\n2.3.4 The timing of events demonstrates a suspicious pattern suggesting strategic litigation rather than genuine concern about financial misconduct;\n\n2.3.5 The systematic transfer of business control to Ms. Rynette Farrar represents a departure from the collaborative business model that operated successfully for [X] years and is the actual cause of any business disruption.\n\n---",

I annex hereto as **JF-NO-WARN** correspondence showing the Applicant provided no warning before the cancellations and as **JF-DISRUPT** evidence of the operational disruption caused by the cancellations.\n\n**148.10** **This sequence of events proves the Applicant manufactured the crisis:**\n\n| Date | Event | Evidence | Significance |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|\n| Mid-June 2025 | Daniel provides all reports to accountant Bantjes | JF-REPORTS-TO-BANTJES, JF-BANTJES-ACK | Daniel cooperated fully with routine tax work |\n| **Next day** | **Applicant secretly cancels all business cards** | **JF-CARD-CANCEL-BANK, JF-PETER-CANCEL-REQUEST** | **Applicant creates crisis without warning** |\n| June 2025 | Services halted, domains down, systems inaccessible | JF-SERVICE-DISRUPTION | Applicant's actions cause operational chaos |\n| June-July 2025 | Applicant demands documentation from Daniel | JF-NO-WARN, JF-DISRUPT | Applicant demands what his own actions made impossible to provide |\n| 11 August 2025 | Settlement agreement signed (JF5) | JF-SETTLEMENT-DRAFT-PRE | Suspicious timing |\n| **13 August 2025** | **Applicant files urgent ex parte interdict** | **JF-TIMELINE-SETTLEMENT** | **2 days after settlement‚Äîcoordinated attack** |\n\n**148.11** üîµ **NEW: The \"Reasonable Director\" Test**\n\nA reasonable director, genuinely concerned about financial misconduct, would:\n- Raise concerns internally with the other directors first\n- Request a meeting to discuss the accountant's findings\n- Provide an opportunity for explanation before taking drastic action\n- Use existing governance structures (such as trust powers) to address concerns\n- Act proportionately to the alleged misconduct\n\n**148.12** The Applicant did none of these things. Instead, he:\n- Cancelled cards without any warning, notice, or discussion\n- Created immediate operational chaos affecting staff and business operations\n- Bypassed all internal processes and governance structures\n- Sought maximum relief (urgent ex parte interdict) as his first response\n- Acted grossly disproportionately to any alleged misconduct\n\n**148.13** **The Applicant's conduct fails the \"reasonable director\" test, proving bad faith rather than genuine concern for the companies' welfare.**\n\n**148.14** üîµ **NEW: Historical Pattern Evidence**\n\nThe Applicant's card cancellation was not standard practice or routine business conduct. I annex hereto as **JF-NO-PRIOR-CANCELLATIONS** historical bank records covering the past [X] years, which demonstrate that **the Applicant has NEVER cancelled business bank cards in this manner before**.\n\n**148.15** This was an unprecedented action, taken specifically in response to Daniel providing reports to the accountant. The unprecedented nature of this action further proves it was part of a manufactured crisis rather than routine business management.\n\n**148.16** By contrast, I annex hereto as **JF-BANTJES-HISTORY** records of Mr. Bantjes' prior visits to our offices, which show that his June 2025 attendance was routine annual tax season work, not a crisis investigation triggered by discovered misconduct.\n\n**148.17** üîµ **NEW: Evidence of Applicant's Knowledge and Intent**\n\nI annex hereto as **JF-PETER-REVIEWED-REPORTS** communications from the Applicant dated before the card cancellations, which demonstrate that the Applicant had reviewed the reports provided to Mr. Bantjes and had the information he now claims was lacking.\n\n**148.18** This evidence destroys the Applicant's narrative that he cancelled cards because he lacked information. The Applicant had the information‚ÄîDaniel had just provided it to the accountant. The Applicant cancelled cards not because he lacked information, but to manufacture a crisis.\n\n**148.19** [If available] I further annex hereto as **JF-PETER-ATTORNEY-PRE** evidence that the Applicant consulted with attorneys before the alleged \"discovery\" of misconduct, proving that the Applicant was planning legal action in advance and manufacturing a pretext to justify it.\n\n**148.20** If the Applicant genuinely wanted documentation and transparency, why cancel the cards **immediately after** Daniel had just provided all reports to the accountant? \n\n**148.21** The only logical explanation is that the Applicant was **setting a trap**‚Äîmanufacturing a pretext for this interdict application.\n\n**148.22** This is not the conduct of a director seeking transparency. This is the conduct of someone orchestrating a crisis to justify seizing control of the businesses.\n\n---"

          "content": "**149.1** It is instructive to consider what the Applicant did **not** do when he claims to have discovered financial misconduct.\n\n**149.2** The Applicant is the founder, trustee, and beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust. I annex hereto as **JF-TRUST-DEED** the Faucitt Family Trust deed, which demonstrates the Applicant's absolute and unlimited powers as founder, trustee, and beneficiary.\n\n**149.3** The Third to Sixth Respondents (the companies subject to this interdict) are [owned/controlled] by or through the Faucitt Family Trust, giving the Applicant ultimate control over these companies through his trust powers.\n\n**149.4** As founder, trustee, and beneficiary, the Applicant has **absolute and unlimited powers** over the trust and, by extension, over the companies. The trust deed provisions annexed as **JF-TRUST-DEED** demonstrate the breadth and scope of these powers.\n\n**149.5** Daniel, by contrast, is merely a beneficiary of the trust with **no powers whatsoever**‚Äînot even the right to respond to trust decisions or to access information about trust affairs. I annex hereto as **JF-DAN-BENEFICIARY** the trust deed provisions showing Daniel's limited status as beneficiary only.\n\n**149.6** I further annex hereto as **JF-TRUST-HISTORY** evidence of the Applicant's historical exercise of trust powers over the companies, demonstrating that the Applicant has routinely used these powers to make decisions affecting the companies' management and operations.\n\n**149.7** If the Applicant genuinely believed that financial misconduct was occurring in the companies, he had multiple avenues available through the trust structure:\n\n**(a)** He could have convened a trustee meeting to address his concerns through proper trust governance;\n\n**(b)** He could have removed Daniel as a director of any of the companies through proper trust procedures;\n\n**(c)** He could have changed banking authorities and signatories through trust resolutions;\n\n**(d)** He could have commissioned a forensic investigation through the trust, at the trust's expense;\n\n**(e)** He could have restructured the companies' management through the trust's ownership powers;\n\n**(f)** He could have implemented any financial controls he deemed necessary through his absolute trust authority.\n\n**149.8** **Instead, the Applicant chose to bypass ALL internal processes** and seek an urgent ex parte interdict, obtaining sweeping relief without notice to me or Daniel and without providing us any opportunity to respond.\n\n**149.9** This choice is revealing. The Applicant did not want:\n- Proper process through trust governance\n- Internal scrutiny of his allegations  \n- An opportunity for us to respond before action was taken\n- Any accountability for his own conduct\n\n**149.10** The Applicant wanted:\n- Immediate control without trust formalities\n- A public court record of allegations against us\n- To freeze our access to the businesses and their finances\n- To avoid scrutiny of his own conduct and motives\n\n**149.11** üîµ **NEW: The \"Cui Bono?\" Analysis (Who Benefits?)**\n\nWhen analyzing suspicious conduct, the law asks: *cui bono?* (who benefits?)\n\n**149.12** If the Applicant's motive was genuinely to protect the companies from financial misconduct, he would have:\n- Used internal trust processes (less disruptive, more effective, and within his existing powers)\n- Acted proportionately to the alleged misconduct\n- Avoided creating operational chaos that harmed the businesses\n- Not timed his actions to coincide with the settlement agreement\n\n**149.13** The Applicant's actual conduct, however, does not benefit the companies. It benefits the Applicant personally:\n- Seizes control ahead of the May 2026 investment payout (9 months away)\n- Creates a public court record discrediting me and Daniel\n- Bypasses trust governance where the Applicant would be accountable for his actions\n- Positions the Applicant to unilaterally control the distribution of a major financial payout\n\n**149.14** I annex hereto as **JF-INVESTMENT-PAYOUT-ANALYSIS** details of the investment payout due in May 2026, which demonstrates:\n- The substantial amount involved\n- The distribution structure\n- How the Applicant's control through this interdict affects distribution\n- The suspicious timing: 9 months from interdict to payout\n\n**149.15** **The Applicant's conduct benefits the Applicant personally, not the companies. This proves ulterior motive.**\n\n**149.16** üîµ **NEW: The \"Alternative Explanation\" Challenge**\n\nThe Applicant must provide an alternative explanation for the suspicious timeline that is more plausible than \"manufactured crisis.\"\n\n**149.17** The Applicant cannot plausibly explain:\n- Why cancel cards the day after Daniel provided reports to the accountant?\n- Why not raise concerns with Daniel before cancelling cards?\n- Why bypass absolute trust powers to seek an urgent interdict?\n- Why file the interdict exactly 2 days after the settlement agreement?\n- Why act exactly 9 months before a major investment payout?\n\n**149.18** If the Applicant cannot provide plausible alternative explanations for these questions, the inference of manufactured crisis is not merely reasonable‚Äîit is proven beyond any other rational explanation.\n\n**149.19** üîµ **NEW: The \"Proportionality\" Argument**\n\nThe Applicant's response was grossly disproportionate to any alleged misconduct.\n\n**149.20** The alleged misconduct consists of:\n- Unexplained IT expenses (which were legitimate business expenses for international operations)\n- An R500,000 payment to me (which was a legitimate director loan account withdrawal)\n\n**149.21** The Applicant's response to these allegations was:\n- Cancelling ALL business bank cards (the \"nuclear option\")\n- Seeking an urgent ex parte interdict (maximum relief without notice)\n- Demanding surrender of all banking cards and documents\n- Authorizing a forensic investigation at the companies' expense\n- Seeking a declaration of delinquency (a career-ending sanction)\n\n**149.22** **This is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.** The gross disproportion between the alleged misconduct and the Applicant's response proves that the Applicant's true motive was not to address financial concerns but to seize control.\n\n**149.23** üîµ **NEW: Why Did the Applicant Need This Interdict?**\n\nGiven the Applicant's absolute trust powers, there are only a few logical explanations for why he sought this urgent interdict:\n\n**(a) The Applicant wanted to avoid trust formalities** that would require proper procedures, documentation, and accountability for his actions;\n\n**(b) The Applicant wanted a public record** of allegations to discredit Daniel and me, serving his broader agenda beyond mere financial control;\n\n**(c) The Applicant wanted to freeze assets and control** ahead of the major investment payout due in May 2026 (9 months after this interdict);\n\n**(d) The Applicant knew his allegations would not survive proper scrutiny** through trust governance where we would have the right to respond and present counter-evidence.\n\n**149.24** The timing supports this analysis:\n- Settlement agreement: 11 August 2025\n- Urgent interdict filed: 13 August 2025 (2 days later)\n- Major investment payout due: May 2026 (9 months after interdict)\n\n**149.25** This is not about financial misconduct. This is about the Applicant seizing control ahead of a major financial event, using manufactured allegations to justify an unnecessary interdict.\n\n**149.26** üîµ **NEW: Material Non-Disclosure of Trust Powers**\n\nThe Applicant's failure to disclose his absolute trust powers in the ex parte application is itself a **material non-disclosure**:\n\n**(a)** The court was not told the Applicant already has absolute control through the trust;\n\n**(b)** The court was not told the Applicant could act through trust procedures to address any genuine concerns;\n\n**(c)** The court was not told this interdict was unnecessary given the Applicant's existing powers;\n\n**(d)** The court was misled into granting relief the Applicant did not need because he already possessed the powers to address his alleged concerns.\n\n**149.27** Had the court been informed of the Applicant's absolute trust powers, it would have:\n- Questioned why the Applicant bypassed internal trust processes\n- Required the Applicant to explain why trust powers were insufficient\n- Likely refused the interdict or granted substantially different relief\n- Recognized the interdict as unnecessary given the Applicant's existing control\n\n**149.28** This material non-disclosure, combined with the other non-disclosures detailed in this affidavit, provides compelling grounds for setting aside the interim order.\n\n---"

Two coincidences might be unfortunate timing. **Five coincidences constitute a pattern of coordination and premeditation.**\n\n**150.4** üîµ **NEW: The \"Material Non-Disclosure Cascade\"**\n\nThe Applicant's multiple material non-disclosures in the ex parte application are not isolated mistakes or oversights‚Äîthey constitute a systematic pattern of deception designed to mislead this Honourable Court.\n\n**150.5** The Applicant failed to disclose:\n\n**(a)** My role as legally designated Responsible Person for 37 international jurisdictions (regulatory duties);\n\n**(b)** The settlement agreement signed 2 days before the interdict (suspicious timing);\n\n**(c)** The May 2026 investment payout (financial motive for seizing control);\n\n**(d)** His transfer of control to a non-director bookkeeper (the Applicant's own questionable conduct);\n\n**(e)** His own unilateral actions causing business disruption (the Applicant created the problems he complains about);\n\n**(f)** **His absolute trust powers making this interdict unnecessary** (the Applicant already had the powers to address his concerns).\n\n**150.6** Six material non-disclosures is not carelessness.

Together, they constitute fraud on the court.\n\n**150.8** üîµ **NEW: Conclusion on Pattern of Bad Faith**\n\nThis is not the conduct of a director genuinely concerned about financial misconduct. This is the conduct of someone orchestrating a crisis to justify seizing control.\n\n**150.9** The Applicant's true motive is revealed by:\n- **What he did NOT do:** Use his absolute trust powers through proper internal processes\n- **WHEN he chose to act:** 2 days after settlement agreement, 9 months before major payout\n- **HOW he chose to act:** Manufactured crisis through card cancellations, then urgent ex parte interdict\n- **WHAT he failed to disclose:** Six material facts that would have caused the court to refuse relief\n\n**150.10** The evidence proves that the Applicant manufactured this crisis, bypassed his existing powers, misled this court through systematic non-disclosure, and seeks to seize control ahead of a major financial event.\n\n**150.11** This pattern of conduct provides compelling grounds for:\n- Setting aside the interim order (obtained through material non-disclosure)\n- Dismissing the application (based on manufactured crisis and bad faith)\n- Costs on an attorney-client scale (punitive costs for abuse of process)\n\n---"
