The regulatory framework does not provide for temporary suspension of these duties. The obligations are continuous and immediate.\n\n3.5.3 The RegimA businesses cannot legally sell cosmetic products in 37 jurisdictions without a Responsible Person who has access to necessary documentation and systems.\n\n3.5.4 Potential consequences include:\n• Immediate regulatory non-compliance in 37 jurisdictions;\n• Regulatory penalties and fines (up to €[amount] per violation under EU law);\n• Mandatory product recalls;\n• Loss of market access affecting R[amount] in annual revenue;\n• Criminal liability for continued sales without proper designation.\n\n3.6 Material Non-Disclosure by Applicant:\n\n3.6.1 The Applicant failed to disclose any of the above facts in his ex parte application.\n\n3.6.2 Had this Honourable Court been aware that the interdict would create immediate regulatory non-compliance in 37 international jurisdictions and expose the businesses to substantial penalties and loss of market access, the Court would likely have:\n(a) Refused to grant the interdict; or\n(b) Crafted different relief that preserved my ability to perform non-delegable legal duties.\n\n3.6.3 This material non-disclosure undermines the foundation of the ex parte interdict.\"\n\n```"

However, the Applicant systematically expanded her access and authority far beyond this role:\n\n(a) System Access:\n• On [date], the Applicant granted Ms. Farrar access to all business financial software systems (Email, Annexure JF-RF1);\n• On [date], the Applicant provided her with all of his passwords and login credentials (Email, Annexure JF-RF2);\n• She now has access to: [list specific systems].\n\n(b) Banking Authority:\n• On [date], Ms. Farrar was granted signatory authority on [list specific bank accounts] (Bank authorization forms, Annexure JF-RF3);\n• She can initiate transactions without requiring co-director approval;\n• She can transfer funds between accounts unilaterally.\n\n(c) Customer and Vendor Communications:\n• Ms. Farrar can email customers directly without director oversight;\n• She can communicate with vendors and make commitments on behalf of the businesses;\n• She operates without any accountability to other directors.\n\n12.2.3 Current Extent of Ms. Farrar's Access:\n\nAs of the date of this affidavit, Ms. Rynette Farrar, a non-director bookkeeper, has:\n• Access to every business bank account;\n• All of the Applicant's passwords and login credentials;\n• Signatory authority on multiple accounts;\n• Ability to initiate transactions without director approval;\n• Ability to email customers and transfer funds unilaterally;\n• Unfettered access to all books of account, customer lists, and financial records.\n\n12.2.4 This level of access and authority for a non-director employee is unprecedented in the [X]-year history of the RegimA businesses.\n\n12.2.5 Concurrent Exclusion of Directors:\n\nConcurrent with Ms. Farrar's expanding access, the Applicant systematically excluded the First and Second Respondents from business oversight:\n\n(a) On [date], my access to [specific system] was restricted (Access logs, Annexure JF-EX1);\n(b) The Second Respondent's access to [specific system] was restricted on [date] (Access logs, Annexure JF-EX2);\n(c) When we raised concerns about unclear transactions, the Applicant characterized our concerns as \"interference\" and defended Ms. Farrar's actions (Email dated [date], Annexure JF-EX3);\n(d) The Applicant stated we should not \"question Rynette\" and that he \"trusts her completely\" (Email dated [date], Annexure JF-EX4).\n\n12.2.6 The Applicant's Actions Caused the Breakdown:\n\nThe breakdown of the collaborative business model was caused by:\n• The Applicant's systematic transfer of control to a non-director employee;\n• The Applicant's concurrent exclusion of directors from oversight;\n• The Applicant's characterization of director oversight as \"interference\";\n• The Applicant's replacement of collaborative decision-making with unilateral control.\n\n12.2.7 This interdict application represents the culmination of this systematic exclusion - the Applicant now seeks to completely remove directors from the businesses while maintaining total control through Ms. Farrar.\"\n\n```"
