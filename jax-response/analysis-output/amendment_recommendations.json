However, the Applicant systematically expanded her access and authority far beyond this role:\n\n(a) System Access:\n\u2022 On [date], the Applicant granted Ms. Farrar access to all business financial software systems (Email, Annexure JF-RF1);\n\u2022 On [date], the Applicant provided her with all of his passwords and login credentials (Email, Annexure JF-RF2);\n\u2022 She now has access to: [list specific systems].\n\n(b) Banking Authority:\n\u2022 On [date], Ms. Farrar was granted signatory authority on [list specific bank accounts] (Bank authorization forms, Annexure JF-RF3);\n\u2022 She can initiate transactions without requiring co-director approval;\n\u2022 She can transfer funds between accounts unilaterally.\n\n(c) Customer and Vendor Communications:\n\u2022 Ms. Farrar can email customers directly without director oversight;\n\u2022 She can communicate with vendors and make commitments on behalf of the businesses;\n\u2022 She operates without any accountability to other directors.\n\n12.2.3 Current Extent of Ms. Farrar's Access:\n\nAs of the date of this affidavit, Ms. Rynette Farrar, a non-director bookkeeper, has:\n\u2022 Access to every business bank account;\n\u2022 All of the Applicant's passwords and login credentials;\n\u2022 Signatory authority on multiple accounts;\n\u2022 Ability to initiate transactions without director approval;\n\u2022 Ability to email customers and transfer funds unilaterally;\n\u2022 Unfettered access to all books of account, customer lists, and financial records.\n\n12.2.4 This level of access and authority for a non-director employee is unprecedented in the [X]-year history of the RegimA businesses.\n\n12.2.5 Concurrent Exclusion of Directors:\n\nConcurrent with Ms. Farrar's expanding access, the Applicant systematically excluded the First and Second Respondents from business oversight:\n\n(a) On [date], my access to [specific system] was restricted (Access logs, Annexure JF-EX1);\n(b) The Second Respondent's access to [specific system] was restricted on [date] (Access logs, Annexure JF-EX2);\n(c) When we raised concerns about unclear transactions, the Applicant characterized our concerns as \"interference\" and defended Ms. Farrar's actions (Email dated [date], Annexure JF-EX3);\n(d) The Applicant stated we should not \"question Rynette\" and that he \"trusts her completely\" (Email dated [date], Annexure JF-EX4).\n\n12.2.6 The Applicant's Actions Caused the Breakdown:\n\nThe breakdown of the collaborative business model was caused by:\n\u2022 The Applicant's systematic transfer of control to a non-director employee;\n\u2022 The Applicant's concurrent exclusion of directors from oversight;\n\u2022 The Applicant's characterization of director oversight as \"interference\";\n\u2022 The Applicant's replacement of collaborative decision-making with unilateral control.\n\n12.2.7 This interdict application represents the culmination of this systematic exclusion - the Applicant now seeks to completely remove directors from the businesses while maintaining total control through Ms. Farrar.\"\n"
