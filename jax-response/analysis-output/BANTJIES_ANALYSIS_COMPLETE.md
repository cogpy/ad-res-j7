## Analysis Framework: Three Critical Questions

**Status:** ✅ Already in v4/v5 affidavits (Section 13B, Part 2)

### Question 3: How Could Bantjies Support Action Against Beneficiary With Trustee Powers?
**Answer:** Breach of fiduciary duty and perjury by omission  
**Status:** ⚠️ NEW - Ready for integration (recommended: Section 13B, Part 3)

## Critical Timeline

| Date | Event | Legal Issue |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **July 2024** | Bantjies appointed trustee | Owes fiduciary duties to ALL beneficiaries including Daniel |
| **Oct 2024** | Bantjies appointed authority | Additional oversight powers and responsibilities |
| **June 6, 2025** | Daniel provides comprehensive reports to Bantjies | Beneficiary seeks proper trust oversight |
| **June 7, 2025** | Peter cancels cards (day after) | Peter manufactures crisis without warning |
| **June 10, 2025 (AM)** | Bantjies identifies R10M missing | Trustee's own finding requires immediate investigation |
| **June 10, 2025 (PM)** | Daniel reports fraud/murder, requests urgent audit | Beneficiary fulfills duty to report to trustee |
| **June 10, 2025 (PM)** | Bantjies: "I am going away for 2 weeks" | Trustee abandons fiduciary duties |
| **Aug 11, 2025** | Peter has Jacqui sign "main trustee" document | Peter bypasses Bantjies' trustee powers |
| **Aug 11, 2025** | Settlement agreement signed | Suspicious same-day coordination |
| **Aug 13, 2025** | Interdict filed | 2 days after bypassing trustee—coordinated attack |
| **Aug 2025** | Bantjies provides supporting affidavit | Perjury by omission—conceals material facts |

**Pattern:** Coordinated effort to bypass proper trust governance and suppress fraud investigation.

## Four Legal Breaches by Bantjies

### 1. Breach of Fiduciary Duty as Trustee
- Failed to investigate fraud allegations reported by beneficiary Daniel
- Supported action against beneficiary without investigation
- Failed to maintain impartiality between beneficiaries
- Acted in Peter's interests to Daniel's detriment

### 2. Perjury by Omission in Supporting Affidavit
- Concealed his own finding of R10 million missing (June 10)
- Concealed Daniel's fraud reports to him (June 6 & 10)
- Concealed murder allegations reported to him
- Concealed his dismissal of audit requests ("going on holiday")
- Concealed his failure to investigate as required by fiduciary duties

### 3. Abuse of Trustee Position
- Used trustee credibility to support false affidavit
- Failed to disclose conflict of interest (trustee supporting one beneficiary against another)
- Enabled action that harmed beneficiary he was duty-bound to protect
- Facilitated bypass of proper trust governance

### 4. Obstruction of Justice
- Dismissed investigation request from beneficiary
- Failed to investigate or report potential crimes
- Supported legal action against whistleblower
- Concealed knowledge of reported crimes from court

---

## Material Non-Disclosures

### Peter's Non-Disclosures (existing)
1. Jacqui's Responsible Person role in 37 jurisdictions
2. Settlement agreement signed 2 days before interdict
3. Peter's absolute trust powers (interdict unnecessary)
4. Peter's card cancellations that created the crisis
5. Peter bypassing Bantjies via "main trustee" appointment

### Bantjies' Non-Disclosures (NEW)
1. His role as trustee with fiduciary duties to Daniel
2. His own finding of R10 million missing (June 10, 2025)
3. Daniel's fraud reports to him (June 6 & 10, 2025)
4. Murder allegations reported to him by Daniel
5. His dismissal of urgent audit requests
6. His failure to investigate as required by fiduciary duties

**Combined Effect:** Court was deceived about the true nature of the dispute (whistleblower being punished rather than protected) and the availability of proper trust remedies (which were deliberately bypassed).

---

## Relief to Request

Based on this analysis, the following relief should be requested:

1. **Setting aside the interim order** (material non-disclosure by both Peter and Bantjies)
2. **Removal of Bantjies as trustee** (breach of fiduciary duty)
3. **Costs against Bantjies personally** (perjury and breach of duty warrant personal costs order)
4. **Investigation into Bantjies' conduct** (potential disciplinary action)
5. **Appointment of independent trustee** (to conduct proper investigation free from conflict)
6. **Referral to appropriate authorities** (potential criminal charges for perjury)

---

## Key Strategic Messages

### For Court
- Bantjies breached fiduciary duties to beneficiary Daniel
- Bantjies committed perjury by concealing material facts
- Peter bypassed proper trust governance to avoid accountability
- Material non-disclosures warrant setting aside interim order

### For Opposition
- Bantjies is compromised witness (breach of duty makes affidavit unreliable)
- Trust processes were available (interdict was unnecessary)
- Daniel sought proper oversight (was punished for reporting fraud)
- Coordination proves bad faith ("main trustee" appointment 2 days before interdict)

### For Narrative
- Whistleblower protection (Daniel reported fraud, was punished not protected)
- Abuse of trust system (trustee used position to harm rather than protect)
- Systemic deception (coordinated effort to bypass proper processes)
- Justice requires accountability (both Peter and Bantjies must answer)
