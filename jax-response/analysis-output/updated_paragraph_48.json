One dealt with a forensic audit (JF4) and the other with medical testing (JF5).\n\n48.2 The JF5 agreement, as initially presented for our review, provided that all three parties (the Applicant, myself, and the Second Respondent) would undergo psychiatric evaluations by mid-October 2025 and drug screening (hair-follicle tests) by early October 2025."

          "content": "üîµ **CRITICAL: LAST-MINUTE MANIPULATION**\n\n48.3 I must bring to this Honourable Court's urgent attention that **material changes were made to the JF5 agreement after our final review and immediately before signing, without proper disclosure to myself and the Second Respondent.**\n\n48.4 **What We Understood During Review:**\n\n48.4.1 The agreement initially reviewed by myself and the Second Respondent stated that:\n- The professionals conducting the assessments would be **jointly selected by the \"parties\"** themselves;\n- Failing agreement between the parties, professionals would be appointed by the Gauteng Family Law Forum;\n- Each party would bear their own costs;\n- The resulting reports would be furnished to the parties.\n\n48.4.2 This structure was consistent with our understanding that this was a **private agreement of voluntary participation between the parties** - not a court-ordered process.\n\n48.4.3 The purpose of having a second, separate agreement (JF5) was specifically to satisfy the requirements of a **private, voluntary arrangement** between family members, given that:\n- The Second Respondent and I are UK citizens and tax residents of the United Kingdom;\n- Our legal capacity in South Africa is limited to economic agreements and taxation matters;\n- We cannot vote or engage in South African civil procedures in general;\n- A private agreement was necessary to accommodate these jurisdictional limitations.\n\n48.5 **The Undisclosed Changes:**\n\n48.5.1 After our final review, the attorneys stated they needed to \"check with the Applicant if everything was acceptable\" and then printed copies for signing.\n\n48.5.2 The Second Respondent specifically asked: **\"Has anything changed?\"**\n\n48.5.3 The attorneys responded: **\"No, we just added the details for the attorneys.\"**\n\n48.5.4 We interpreted this to mean administrative contact information or similar clerical additions.\n\n48.5.5 However, **in the final documents presented for signature**, the following fundamental changes had been made without our knowledge:\n\n**(a)** Every instance of **\"parties\"** had been changed to **\"parties' attorneys\"**;\n\n**(b)** Control over selection of professionals was transferred from the parties themselves to their attorneys;\n\n**(c)** The reference to the **Gauteng Family Law Forum was removed entirely** from the final version;\n\n**(d)** The agreement now granted attorneys unilateral control over professional selection.\n\n48.6 **Why These Changes Are Material:**\n\n48.6.1 **Transfer of Control:** The change from \"parties\" to \"parties' attorneys\" fundamentally altered the nature of the agreement from a voluntary, party-controlled process to an attorney-controlled process.\n\n48.6.2 **Removal of Neutral Arbiter:** The removal of the Gauteng Family Law Forum as the failsafe appointment mechanism eliminated the neutral third-party oversight that we had specifically negotiated.\n\n48.6.3 **Jurisdictional Concerns Not Addressed:** Had these changes been disclosed during our review, we would have explained again that:\n- We are UK tax residents with limited legal capacity in South Africa;\n- We cannot participate in South African civil procedures in the general sense;\n- The entire purpose of a separate, private agreement was to accommodate these limitations;\n- Transferring control to South African attorneys defeats this purpose.\n\n48.7 **Additional Undisclosed Scope Expansion:**\n\n48.7.1 The agreement as signed also contained provisions for **additional services and \"treatments\"** that were never mentioned or discussed during negotiations.\n\n48.7.2 We understood the agreement to provide for a **once-off evaluation event** - psychiatric assessment and drug screening, with reports furnished to the parties.\n\n48.7.3 However, the final agreement appears to contemplate:\n- Ongoing \"treatments\" of an unspecified nature;\n- Additional services to be provisioned without term limits on scope or duration;\n- Decisions to be made arbitrarily by professionals regarding the need for further procedures;\n- An open-ended financial obligation for services never agreed to.\n\n48.7.4 There was **no discussion whatsoever** of:\n- Ongoing treatment obligations;\n- Open-ended scope for additional procedures;\n- Unspecified professionals having authority to mandate further services;\n- Unlimited duration or cost exposure.\n\n48.8 **Misrepresentation and Reliance:**\n\n48.8.1 The attorneys' statement that \"nothing changed\" except \"details for the attorneys\" constituted a **material misrepresentation**.\n\n48.8.2 We **relied on this false assurance** when signing the agreement.\n\n48.8.3 Had we been informed of the actual changes, we would have:\n- Refused to sign without further negotiation;\n- Insisted on restoration of party control over professional selection;\n- Insisted on retention of the Gauteng Family Law Forum failsafe mechanism;\n- Sought clarification on scope, duration, and cost limitations;\n- Obtained independent legal advice on the jurisdictional implications.\n\n48.9 **Connection to Weaponization of Medical Testing:**\n\n48.9.1 The manipulation of the JF5 agreement must be understood in the context of the Applicant's pattern of using medical testing as a control mechanism.\n\n48.9.2 By transferring control to attorneys and removing neutral oversight, the agreement creates a framework where:\n- Professionals can be selected who are predisposed to find \"issues\" requiring treatment;\n- Disagreement with the Applicant's demands can be characterized as evidence of mental health problems;\n- Open-ended \"treatments\" can be mandated at our expense;\n- Refusal to comply can be used as evidence of \"non-cooperation\" or \"mental instability.\"\n\n48.9.3 This is consistent with the Applicant's historical pattern of weaponizing professional opinions to enforce compliance with his demands.\n\n48.10 **Legal Consequences:**\n\n48.10.1 The JF5 agreement was obtained through **fraud in the inducement**, specifically:\n- Material changes were made after final review;\n- The changes were concealed through false assurances;\n- We relied on the attorneys' misrepresentation;\n- We are now purportedly bound to terms we never agreed to.\n\n48.10.2 I respectfully submit that the JF5 agreement should be declared **void or voidable** due to these fraudulent circumstances.\n\n48.10.3 At minimum, the agreement should be reformed to reflect the terms we actually reviewed and agreed to:\n- Party control over professional selection (not attorney control);\n- Gauteng Family Law Forum as failsafe appointment mechanism;\n- Once-off evaluation only (no ongoing treatments);\n- Clear scope and cost limitations.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è **STRATEGIC NOTE:** This is a CRITICAL addition that exposes the manipulation of the settlement agreement. Ensure you have:\n- Copy of the draft agreement as initially reviewed (if available)\n- Copy of the final signed agreement showing the changes\n- Witness statement from Daniel confirming the \"Has anything changed?\" exchange\n- Documentation of UK tax residency and jurisdictional limitations\n- Timeline showing settlement (11 Aug) ‚Üí interdict filing (13 Aug) - only 2 days later\n\n---\n\n**EVIDENCE CHECKLIST FOR PARAGRAPH 48:**\n\n‚òê JF5 draft agreement (initial version reviewed)\n‚òê JF5 final agreement (signed version with changes)\n‚òê Comparison document highlighting all changes\n‚òê Daniel's witness statement re: \"Has anything changed?\" exchange\n‚òê UK tax residency documentation\n‚òê Legal opinion on jurisdictional limitations\n‚òê Timeline documentation (settlement date vs interdict filing date)\n‚òê Evidence of historical pattern of weaponizing medical testing (if available)"
