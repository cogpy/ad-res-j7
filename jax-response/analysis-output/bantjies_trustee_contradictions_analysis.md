**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Author:** Comprehensive Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis exposes critical contradictions in Daniel Jacobus Bantjies' role as trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust and his conduct surrounding the ex parte interdict. Key issues include:

1. **Contradictory Roles:** Appointed as trustee in July 2024 and authority in October 2024, yet Peter had Jacqui sign making him "main trustee" on August 11, 2025
2. **Ignored Fiduciary Duties:** Received fraud reports from beneficiary Daniel on June 6 and 10, 2025, but dismissed urgent audit requests
3. **Perjury in Supporting Affidavit:** Despite knowing about financial fraud and murder, provided supporting affidavit for ex parte interdict in August 2025
4. **Breach of Trust Obligations:** Failed to investigate reported fraud, then supported action against the very beneficiary who reported it

---

## Timeline of Bantjies' Appointments and Conduct

### July 2024: Initial Trustee Appointment

**Event:** Daniel Jacobus Bantjies appointed as trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust

**Significance:**
- Bantjies gained trustee powers and fiduciary duties to all beneficiaries
- This included beneficiary Daniel Faucitt, who had no powers (beneficiary only status)
- As trustee, Bantjies had duty to act in good faith and in the interests of ALL beneficiaries
- As trustee, Bantjies had authority over trust matters and could conduct investigations

**Legal Implications:**
- Trustee has fiduciary duty to investigate fraud allegations
- Trustee must act impartially between beneficiaries
- Trustee cannot support actions against beneficiaries without proper investigation

### October 2024: Authority Appointment

**Event:** Bantjies appointed as authority within trust structure

**Significance:**
- Additional layer of power and responsibility
- Further reinforced Bantjies' position to investigate and address trust matters
- Increased obligation to act in beneficiaries' interests

**Questions Raised:**
- What specific authority was granted?
- Why was additional authority needed if already trustee?
- Did this authority include power to make binding decisions?

### August 11, 2025: "Main Trustee" Appointment

**Event:** Peter has Jacqui sign document making him (Peter) the "main trustee"

**Timeline Context:**
- August 11, 2025: Settlement agreement signed / "Main Trustee" document signed
- August 13, 2025: Peter files founding affidavit for ex parte interdict
- August 14, 2025: Interdict application filed
- August 19, 2025: Ex parte interdict granted

**Critical Questions:**

#### Q1: Why Was "Main Trustee" Appointment Necessary?

If Peter already had "absolute unlimited powers" as founder, trustee, and beneficiary (as claimed in existing analysis), why did he need Jacqui to sign making him "main trustee"?

**Possible Explanations:**
- **A. Peter's powers were NOT absolute** - He actually needed co-trustee approval for certain actions
- **B. Jacqui had veto power** - Her trustee role gave her ability to block Peter's unilateral actions
- **C. Trust deed required co-trustee consent** - For major decisions affecting beneficiaries
- **D. Strategic manipulation** - Document signed 2 days before interdict as part of coordinated plan

#### Q2: What Role Did Bantjies Have in This Appointment?

As trustee (since July 2024) and authority (since Oct 2024), Bantjies should have been involved in or consulted about any changes to trustee structure.

**Critical Issues:**
- Was Bantjies consulted about the "main trustee" appointment?
- Did Bantjies approve this change to trust governance?
- If not consulted, why was he bypassed despite having trustee powers?
- If consulted, why didn't he object given the timing (2 days before interdict)?

#### Q3: What Happened to Bantjies' Trustee Powers?

**The Fundamental Contradiction:**

If Bantjies was appointed as trustee in July 2024 and authority in October 2024, he had:
- Fiduciary duties to ALL beneficiaries (including Daniel)
- Authority to investigate fraud allegations
- Power to call trustee meetings
- Obligation to act in trust's best interests

Yet when Daniel reported fraud to him in June 2025, Bantjies:
- Dismissed urgent audit requests ("going on holiday for 2 weeks")
- Failed to investigate despite identifying R10 million missing himself
- Failed to fulfill his fiduciary duties to beneficiary Daniel
- Then supported ex parte interdict against the very beneficiary who sought his help

**How could Bantjies, as trustee, provide a supporting affidavit AGAINST beneficiary Daniel?**

This represents either:
- **A. Breach of fiduciary duty** - Trustee supporting action against beneficiary without investigation
- **B. Abuse of trustee position** - Using trustee authority to harm rather than protect beneficiary
- **C. Conspiracy** - Coordinated effort to suppress fraud investigation and silence whistleblower
- **D. Perjury** - False statements in affidavit knowing they would harm beneficiary he's duty-bound to protect

---

## June 2025: Daniel Reports Fraud to Bantjies

### June 6, 2025: Initial Documentation to Bantjies

**Event:** Daniel emails comprehensive reports to Bantjies

**Content:**
- Listing of all companies under management
- Details of Shopify store operations
- Preliminary financial reports
- Documentation ahead of audit discussions

**Significance:**
- Daniel provided FULL TRANSPARENCY to trustee
- Daniel was seeking proper trust oversight
- Daniel was fulfilling duty to report concerns to trustee
- Bantjies received all information needed to investigate

**Evidence Required:**
- Email from Daniel to Bantjies dated June 6, 2025
- Attachments showing comprehensive company listings
- Shopify store documentation
- Preliminary reports provided

### June 10, 2025 (Morning): Bantjies Identifies Financial Fraud

**Event:** Bantjies sends email identifying serious financial issues

**Bantjies' Own Findings:**
- Documents R10 million missing from bank accounts
- Notes "substantial trading loss" - first in company history
- Questions computer expenses exceeding 20% of revenue
- Raises concerns about SARS investigation
- Sends email to Peter, Jacqui, and Daniel

**Significance:**
- Bantjies HIMSELF identified the fraud
- As trustee, he had duty to investigate immediately
- As authority, he had power to demand documents and conduct audit
- Email proves he knew of serious issues requiring investigation

### June 10, 2025 (Same Day): Daniel Reports Murder and Theft to Bantjies

**Event:** Daniel responds to Bantjies' email with additional critical information

**Daniel's Report to Trustee:**
- Informs Bantjies about Kayla's murder (August 2023)
- Reports Peter stealing funds after murder
- Details over R1.8 million owed to Rezonance
- Requests URGENT AUDIT from trustee

**Bantjies' Response:** "I am going away for 2 weeks"

**Context:**
- Peter was CC'd on this email - Peter knew Daniel was reporting his crimes to trustee
- Bantjies now knew about:
  - Murder of business partner
  - Theft by Peter following murder
  - R10 million missing (his own finding)
  - R1.8 million debt to Rezonance
  - Request for urgent audit from beneficiary

**Bantjies' Fiduciary Duty Response Should Have Been:**
1. Immediately convene trustee meeting
2. Launch investigation into fraud allegations
3. Protect reporting beneficiary (Daniel) from retaliation
4. Report potential crimes to authorities
5. Suspend any trust actions that could prejudice investigation
6. Act impartially between beneficiaries pending investigation

**Bantjies' Actual Response:**
- Dismissed urgent audit request
- Went on holiday instead of investigating
- Failed to protect beneficiary who reported fraud
- Failed to investigate trustee Peter's alleged theft
- Later provided supporting affidavit against reporting beneficiary

---

## August 2025: Bantjies Provides Supporting Affidavit

### The Perjury

**Event:** Bantjies provides supporting affidavit for Peter's ex parte interdict application

**What Bantjies Knew by This Point:**
1. R10 million missing (his own finding on June 10)
2. Kayla's murder in August 2023 (Daniel's report June 10)
3. Peter's alleged theft after murder (Daniel's report June 10)
4. R1.8 million debt to Rezonance (Daniel's report June 10)
5. Daniel had requested urgent audit (June 10)
6. Daniel had provided full transparency (June 6)
7. Daniel was acting to protect business interests

**What Bantjies Did NOT Disclose in Affidavit:**
- His own finding of R10 million missing
- Daniel's fraud reports to him on June 6 and 10
- Murder of business partner
- Peter's alleged theft
- Daniel's requests for urgent audit
- His own failure to investigate as trustee
- His dismissal of audit requests ("going on holiday")

**What Bantjies DID in Affidavit:**
- Supported Peter's allegations against Daniel
- Provided professional credibility to interdict application
- Failed to mention material facts he knew
- Enabled ex parte order without proper disclosure

### The Fundamental Contradiction

**As Trustee (July 2024 - Present):**
- Bantjies had fiduciary duty to beneficiary Daniel
- Bantjies had authority to investigate fraud
- Bantjies had obligation to protect all beneficiaries equally
- Bantjies had duty to act in trust's best interests

**As Supporting Affiant (August 2025):**
- Bantjies supported action AGAINST beneficiary Daniel
- Bantjies provided no evidence of investigation
- Bantjies concealed material facts he knew
- Bantjies enabled Peter's action against beneficiary who sought his help

**How is this not a direct breach of fiduciary duty and perjury?**

---

## Legal Analysis: Bantjies' Breaches

### 1. Breach of Fiduciary Duty as Trustee

**Duty Owed:** To act in good faith in the interests of all beneficiaries

**Breach:**
- Failed to investigate fraud allegations reported by beneficiary Daniel
- Supported action against beneficiary without investigation
- Acted in Peter's interests to Daniel's detriment
- Failed to maintain impartiality between beneficiaries

**Evidence:**
- June 6 email: Daniel provides full documentation to trustee
- June 10 email: Daniel reports fraud and requests urgent audit
- June 10 response: Bantjies dismisses audit request ("going on holiday")
- August affidavit: Bantjies supports action against reporting beneficiary

### 2. Perjury in Supporting Affidavit

**False Statement by Omission:** Material non-disclosure of facts known to be relevant

**Material Facts Concealed:**
- His own finding of R10 million missing
- Daniel's fraud reports and audit requests
- Murder of business partner
- His dismissal of audit requests
- His failure to investigate as trustee

**Intent:** Bantjies knew these facts were material to court's decision

**Effect:** Court granted ex parte interdict without knowing:
- Trustee had been asked to investigate but refused
- Beneficiary had sought proper trust oversight but was ignored
- Applicant (Peter) was subject of fraud allegations himself
- Trustee was supporting applicant despite not investigating

### 3. Abuse of Trustee Position

**Position Held:** Trustee with fiduciary duties to all beneficiaries

**Abuse:**
- Used trustee credibility to support affidavit
- Failed to disclose his trustee role created conflict of interest
- Supported one beneficiary (Peter) against another (Daniel) without investigation
- Enabled action that prevented beneficiary Daniel from accessing business operations

**Harm:**
- Daniel prevented from accessing business records
- Daniel prevented from responding to allegations
- Court misled about trustee's actual knowledge
- Trust governance bypassed entirely

### 4. Obstruction of Justice

**Event:** Daniel reported potential crimes to Bantjies as trustee in June

**Bantjies' Response:**
- Dismissed investigation request
- Failed to investigate or report crimes
- Later supported legal action against reporter
- Concealed knowledge of reported crimes from court

**Effect:**
- Potential crimes not investigated
- Whistleblower punished rather than protected
- Evidence potentially destroyed or concealed
- Court prevented from knowing material facts

---

## Strategic Significance: Why the Interdict Was Necessary

### Question: Given Bantjies' Trustee Powers, Why Did Peter Need the Interdict?

**Bantjies as Trustee (July 2024) Could Have:**
1. Conducted investigation into fraud allegations
2. Convened trustee meeting to address concerns
3. Suspended Daniel's access to business operations if warranted
4. Commissioned forensic audit
5. Made binding decisions about trust property
6. Acted through proper trust governance channels

**Peter Chose Interdict Instead:**
- Bypassed trustee Bantjies entirely for "main trustee" appointment (Aug 11)
- Filed ex parte interdict 2 days later (Aug 13)
- Obtained court order instead of using trust processes
- Prevented scrutiny of his own conduct
- Created public record of allegations without investigation

### Logical Inferences:

#### A. Bantjies Could Not Legally Support Peter's Claims
- If Bantjies investigated as trustee, he would have to report:
  - His own finding of R10 million missing
  - Murder allegations
  - Peter's alleged theft
  - Daniel's transparency and cooperation
- Investigation would expose Peter's conduct rather than Daniel's

#### B. Trust Processes Would Require Impartiality
- As trustee, Bantjies should act impartially between beneficiaries
- Proper investigation would give Daniel opportunity to respond
- Trust governance would require documentation and accountability
- Peter's allegations might not survive scrutiny

#### C. Peter Needed to Avoid Trust Oversight
- Ex parte interdict bypassed Bantjies as trustee
- Court order obtained without trust governance
- No trustee investigation required
- No beneficiary rights to respond
- Immediate control without accountability

#### D. Bantjies Was Complicit in Avoiding Proper Process
- Bantjies failed to investigate when asked (June)
- Bantjies supported interdict bypassing trust process (August)
- Bantjies concealed material facts from court
- Bantjies enabled Peter to avoid trust governance

**Conclusion:** The interdict was necessary because proper trust processes through Bantjies would have:
- Required investigation of Peter's conduct
- Given Daniel opportunity to respond
- Exposed Peter's alleged crimes
- Required impartial trustee action
- Created documentary record of truth

## Recommended Affidavit Language

### Section: Bantjies' Contradictory Role as Trustee

> **[XX.1]** The Court should be aware of the peculiar and contradictory role played by Mr. Daniel Jacobus Bantjies in these proceedings.
>
> **[XX.2]** Mr. Bantjies was appointed as a trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust in July 2024 and was appointed as an authority within the trust structure in October 2024. As trustee, Mr. Bantjies owed fiduciary duties to all beneficiaries of the trust, including the Second Respondent (Daniel).
>
> **[XX.3]** Despite these appointments giving Mr. Bantjies both power and responsibility to oversee trust matters, the Applicant saw fit to have me sign a document on 11 August 2025 making him the "main trustee." This occurred merely 2 days before filing this interdict application.
>
> **[XX.4]** This raises several critical questions:
> - If Mr. Bantjies had trustee powers since July 2024, why was a "main trustee" appointment necessary?
> - Why was this appointment made 2 days before the interdict, suggesting coordination?
> - What happened to Mr. Bantjies' trustee powers and fiduciary duties?

### Section: Bantjies Ignored Daniel's Fraud Reports

> **[XX.5]** On 6 June 2025, the Second Respondent provided comprehensive documentation to Mr. Bantjies, including listings of all companies under management, Shopify store operations, and preliminary financial reports. I annex hereto marked **JF-BANTJIES-REPORTS-06JUN** the email and attachments showing this full transparency.
>
> **[XX.6]** On 10 June 2025, Mr. Bantjies himself identified serious financial issues, including R10 million missing from bank accounts and what he termed a "substantial trading loss." I annex hereto marked **JF-BANTJIES-FRAUD-EMAIL-10JUN** the email from Mr. Bantjies documenting these findings.
>
> **[XX.7]** On the same day (10 June 2025), the Second Respondent responded to Mr. Bantjies, reporting:
> - The murder of business partner Kayla in August 2023
> - The Applicant's alleged theft of funds following the murder
> - Over R1.8 million owed to Rezonance
> - A request for an URGENT AUDIT
>
> I annex hereto marked **JF-DAN-FRAUD-REPORT-10JUN** the email from the Second Respondent to Mr. Bantjies requesting urgent investigation.
>
> **[XX.8]** As a trustee with fiduciary duties to the Second Respondent (a beneficiary), Mr. Bantjies' response should have been immediate investigation. Instead, his response was: **"I am going away for 2 weeks."**
>
> **[XX.9]** Mr. Bantjies:
> - Failed to investigate fraud allegations reported by beneficiary
> - Failed to conduct the urgent audit requested
> - Failed to protect the beneficiary who reported potential crimes
> - Failed to investigate the Applicant's alleged theft
> - Dismissed his fiduciary duties in favor of a holiday

### Section: Bantjies' Perjury in Supporting Affidavit

> **[XX.10]** Despite these failures, Mr. Bantjies provided a supporting affidavit for the Applicant's ex parte interdict application in August 2025.
>
> **[XX.11]** By the time of that affidavit, Mr. Bantjies knew:
> - R10 million was missing (his own finding on 10 June 2025)
> - The Second Respondent had reported murder and theft (10 June 2025)
> - The Second Respondent had requested urgent audit (10 June 2025)
> - The Second Respondent had provided full transparency (6 June 2025)
> - He had failed to investigate as trustee despite his fiduciary duties
>
> **[XX.12]** None of these material facts were disclosed in Mr. Bantjies' supporting affidavit.
>
> **[XX.13]** Instead, Mr. Bantjies lent his professional credibility and trustee authority to support the Applicant's allegations against the very beneficiary who had sought his help as trustee.
>
> **[XX.14]** This constitutes:
> - Breach of fiduciary duty (supporting action against beneficiary without investigation)
> - Perjury by omission (concealing material facts from court)
> - Abuse of trustee position (using authority to harm beneficiary he's duty-bound to protect)
> - Obstruction of justice (suppressing fraud reports and murder allegations)

### Section: The Fundamental Question

> **[XX.15]** The Court must ask: **How could Mr. Bantjies, as a trustee with fiduciary duties to the Second Respondent, provide a supporting affidavit against that beneficiary without investigating the fraud allegations that beneficiary reported to him?**
>
> **[XX.16]** There are only a few possible explanations:
>
> **(a)** Mr. Bantjies knew the allegations were false but provided the affidavit anyway (perjury and breach of duty);
>
> **(b)** Mr. Bantjies failed to investigate as required by his fiduciary duties, then supported action against the beneficiary who sought his help (gross negligence and breach of duty);
>
> **(c)** Mr. Bantjies was part of a coordinated effort to suppress the fraud investigation and silence the whistleblower beneficiary (conspiracy);
>
> **(d)** Mr. Bantjies' trustee role was always illusory, and he was acting in the Applicant's interests rather than impartially (breach of duty and fraud on the trust).
>
> **[XX.17]** Under any of these explanations, Mr. Bantjies' affidavit is fundamentally unreliable and should be given no weight. More importantly, his concealment of material facts from this Court provides additional grounds for setting aside the interim order.

### Section: Why the Interdict Was Necessary Despite Bantjies' Trustee Powers

> **[XX.18]** The contradictions in Mr. Bantjies' role also illuminate why the Applicant needed this interdict despite claiming "absolute unlimited powers" through the trust structure.
>
> **[XX.19]** If Mr. Bantjies was a functioning trustee with proper powers, the Applicant could have:
> - Asked trustee Bantjies to investigate the fraud allegations
> - Convened a trustee meeting to address concerns through proper governance
> - Commissioned a forensic audit through the trust structure
> - Taken action through trust processes with proper accountability
>
> **[XX.20]** Instead, the Applicant:
> - Had me sign a "main trustee" document on 11 August 2025 (bypassing Bantjies)
> - Filed this interdict 2 days later (bypassing trust governance)
> - Obtained ex parte relief without notice (bypassing beneficiary rights)
> - Created a court record of allegations without investigation (bypassing accountability)
>
> **[XX.21]** The only logical explanation is that proper trust processes would have required:
> - Impartial investigation giving the Second Respondent opportunity to respond
> - Disclosure of the Applicant's own alleged misconduct
> - Accountability for the Applicant's actions (card cancellations, system lockouts)
> - Protection of the beneficiary who reported fraud rather than punishment
>
> **[XX.22]** The Applicant needed the interdict precisely because trust processes would have exposed his conduct rather than the Second Respondent's.

## Integration with Existing Analysis

### Strengthens "Unnecessary Interdict" Argument

This analysis adds a third dimension to why Peter needed the interdict:

1. **Peter's Trust Powers** - Already had absolute powers (existing analysis)
2. **Daniel's Lack of Powers** - Beneficiary only, no rights (existing analysis)
3. **Bantjies' Trustee Powers** - NEW: Could have investigated through trust but was bypassed

### Strengthens "Bad Faith" Pattern

This analysis adds another element to pattern of bad faith:

1. Card cancellation after reports provided (existing analysis)
2. Unnecessary interdict despite trust powers (existing analysis)
3. Settlement timing suspicious (existing analysis)
4. **NEW: Bypassing trustee who had duty to investigate**
5. **NEW: Using perjured affidavit from trustee who failed duties**
6. **NEW: Punishing beneficiary who sought proper trust oversight**

### Adds Material Non-Disclosure

Court was not told:

1. Jacqui's Responsible Person role (existing analysis)
2. Settlement 2 days before interdict (existing analysis)
3. Peter's trust powers made interdict unnecessary (existing analysis)
4. **NEW: Bantjies was trustee with duty to investigate**
5. **NEW: Daniel reported fraud to Bantjies in June**
6. **NEW: Bantjies refused to investigate**
7. **NEW: Bantjies knew material facts he didn't disclose**

---

## Conclusion

The Bantjies trustee contradictions expose the most fundamental flaw in Peter's case: **A trustee with fiduciary duties to Daniel provided a supporting affidavit against Daniel without investigating Daniel's fraud reports to that trustee.**

This is not merely suspicious conduct—it is direct evidence of:
- Breach of fiduciary duty by Bantjies
- Perjury by omission in Bantjies' affidavit
- Conspiracy to suppress fraud investigation
- Abuse of trust processes
- Material non-disclosure to the Court

The fact that Peter bypassed Bantjies' trustee powers (via "main trustee" appointment 2 days before interdict) proves Peter knew proper trust processes would not support his claims.

**This evidence alone provides grounds for setting aside the interim order and removing Bantjies as trustee for breach of fiduciary duty.**
