**Purpose:** Establishes what reasonable director would do in similar circumstances

**Strengthens:** Shows Peter's conduct was unreasonable and outside norms

**Expert Should Opine:**

---

**Annexure:** JF-COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS

**Purpose:** Shows Peter's approach was extraordinary

**Strengthens:** Demonstrates Peter's conduct was outside normal business practice

---

## 6. Financial Impact Evidence

**Priority:** MEDIUM

### 6.1 Quantification of financial harm caused by card cancellations

**Annexure:** JF-FINANCIAL-HARM

**Purpose:** Demonstrates Peter's actions caused measurable damage

**Strengthens:** Shows Peter's conduct was harmful, not protective

**Should Quantify:**
- Lost revenue due to service disruptions
- Cost of restoring services
- Late fees and penalties from service providers
- Staff time lost dealing with crisis
- Potential client losses due to service interruptions

---

### 6.2 Analysis of May 2026 investment payout

**Annexure:** JF-INVESTMENT-PAYOUT-ANALYSIS

**Purpose:** Establishes Peter's financial motive

**Strengthens:** Proves ulterior motive for seizing control

**Should Detail:**
- Amount of investment payout expected
- Distribution structure (how would funds be distributed?)
- Peter's control through interdict affects distribution
- Timing: 9 months from interdict to payout

---

## Additional Strategic Arguments

Beyond additional evidence, the following arguments could further strengthen Section 13B:

### 1. The "Reasonable Director" Test

**Argument:** A reasonable director, genuinely concerned about financial misconduct, would:
- Raise concerns internally first
- Request a meeting to discuss findings
- Use existing governance structures (trust powers)
- Provide opportunity for explanation before taking drastic action
- Act proportionately to the alleged misconduct

**Peter did none of these things.** Instead, he:
- Cancelled cards without warning or discussion
- Created operational chaos
- Bypassed all internal processes
- Sought maximum relief (interdict) as first response
- Acted disproportionately to any alleged misconduct

**Conclusion:** Peter's conduct fails the "reasonable director" test, proving bad faith.

---

### 2. The "Cui Bono?" Analysis (Who Benefits?)

**Argument:** When analyzing suspicious conduct, ask: who benefits?

**If Peter's motive was genuinely to protect the companies:**
- He would have used internal processes (less disruptive, more effective)
- He would have acted proportionately
- He would not have created operational chaos
- He would not have timed action to coincide with settlement agreement

**Peter's actual conduct benefits Peter personally:**
- Seizes control ahead of May 2026 investment payout
- Creates public record discrediting Jax and Daniel
- Bypasses trust governance where he would be accountable
- Positions him to control distribution of major financial payout

**Conclusion:** Peter's conduct benefits Peter personally, not the companies.

---

### 3. The "Alternative Explanation" Challenge

**Argument:** Peter must provide an alternative explanation for the suspicious timeline that is more plausible than manufactured crisis.

**Questions Peter cannot answer:**
- Why cancel cards the day after Daniel provided reports?
- Why not raise concerns with Daniel before cancelling cards?
- Why bypass absolute trust powers to seek interdict?
- Why file interdict 2 days after settlement agreement?
- Why act 9 months before major investment payout?

**If Peter cannot provide plausible alternative explanations, the inference of manufactured crisis is proven.**

---

### 4. The "Proportionality" Argument

**Argument:** Peter's response was grossly disproportionate to any alleged misconduct.

**Alleged misconduct:** Unexplained IT expenses and R500K payment (which was legitimate director loan account withdrawal)

**Peter's response:**
- Cancelled ALL business cards (nuclear option)
- Sought urgent ex parte interdict (maximum relief)
- Demanded surrender of all banking cards and documents
- Authorized forensic investigation at companies' expense
- Sought declaration of delinquency (career-ending sanction)

**This is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.** The gross disproportion proves ulterior motive.

---

### 5. The "Timing Coincidence" Argument

**Argument:** The timing of events is too coincidental to be innocent.

**Coincidences:**
1. Card cancellations day after Daniel provided reports
2. Interdict filed 2 days after settlement agreement
3. Interdict filed 9 months before major investment payout
4. Settlement agreement manipulated in final minutes before signing
5. All events clustered in June-August 2025 period

**One coincidence might be innocent. Five coincidences constitute a pattern.**

**Conclusion:** This is not coincidence—it is coordination and premeditation.

---

### 6. The "Material Non-Disclosure Cascade" Argument

**Argument:** Peter's multiple material non-disclosures in the ex parte application are not isolated mistakes—they are a systematic pattern of deception.

**Peter failed to disclose:**
1. Jax's Responsible Person role (regulatory duties)
2. Settlement agreement 2 days before (suspicious timing)
3. May 2026 investment payout (financial motive)
4. Transfer of control to non-director bookkeeper (Peter's own conduct)
5. His own unilateral actions causing disruption (Peter created the problems)
6. **His absolute trust powers (interdict was unnecessary)**

**Six material non-disclosures is not carelessness—it is systematic deception designed to mislead the court.**

**Conclusion:** The pattern of non-disclosures proves Peter obtained the interdict through fraud on the court.

5. **JF-DANIEL-AFFIDAVIT** - Daniel's first-hand account

### Priority 2: Strengthening Evidence (Obtain Before Filing)

6. **JF-NO-PRIOR-CANCELLATIONS** - Historical records showing Peter never cancelled cards before
7. **JF-PETER-WITHDRAWALS-HISTORY** - Peter's own withdrawals without documentation
8. **JF-SERVICE-DISRUPTION** - Service disruption notifications
9. **JF-FINANCIAL-HARM** - Quantification of harm caused by Peter's actions
10. **JF-INVESTMENT-PAYOUT-ANALYSIS** - Analysis of May 2026 payout

13. **JF-PETER-ATTORNEY-PRE** - Evidence Peter consulted attorneys before alleged crisis

---

## Conclusion

Section 13B is already strong, but these additional evidence items and arguments would transform it from "compelling narrative" to "proven fact pattern."

**Key Priorities:**
1. **Prove the timeline with precision** (documentary evidence of dates)
2. **Obtain independent corroboration** (Bantjes affidavit)
3. **Establish Peter's knowledge** (communications showing he reviewed reports before acting)
4. **Demonstrate unprecedented action** (Peter never cancelled cards before)
5. **Quantify the harm** (financial impact of Peter's actions)

With these additions, Section 13B would be virtually unassailable.
