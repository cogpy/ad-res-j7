## Current Version: v3

**File:** `analysis-output/REVISED_Answering_Affidavit_Jax_TRACKED_CHANGES_v3.md`

### Critical Corrections in v3:

#### Paragraph 48 - Settlement Agreement Manipulation (JF5)
- Clarified: Gauteng Family Law Forum was **NOT** in original draft
- Added: Evidence of copy-paste manipulation (duplicate "bear costs" clauses)
- Documented: "Has anything changed?" - "No, just details for attorneys" exchange
- Established: Fraud in the inducement argument

#### Paragraph 129 - Isaac Chesno Fraud
- Corrected: Isaac Chesno committed massive fraud (over ¬£500,000)
- Documented: Chesno disappeared after stealing funds
- Established: Daniel spent **8 YEARS** restoring UK company to break-even
- Clarified: Daniel's appointment was **BECAUSE of Chesno's fraud**, not "arising from wrongdoing"
- Exposed: Peter's deliberate mischaracterization demonstrates bad faith

---

## Strategic Framework

The revised affidavit establishes seven key arguments:

1. **Material Non-Disclosure** - Peter obtained interdict through fraud (ex parte application)
2. **Peter's Inconsistency** - Accepted informal practices for years, now weaponizes them
3. **Peter Created Problems** - Card cancellations, system lockouts, Rynette empowerment
4. **Timing Reveals Motive** - Settlement manipulation ‚Üí 2 days ‚Üí interdict ‚Üí 9 months ‚Üí payout
5. **Pattern of Misrepresentation** - Settlement agreement, R500K payment, IT expenses, Chesno fraud
6. **Daniel's Competence** - 8 years rescuing ¬£500K+ fraud-damaged company
7. **Regulatory Crisis** - Interdict creates immediate non-compliance in 37 jurisdictions

---

## Key Material Non-Disclosures

Peter failed to disclose in his ex parte application:

### 1. Jax's Responsible Person Role
- Legally designated Responsible Person for RegimA products in **37 international jurisdictions**
- Non-delegable duties under EU Regulation 1223/2009
- Interdict prevents performance of legal obligations
- Creates immediate regulatory non-compliance

### 2. Settlement Agreement Signed 8 Days Before
- Settlement signed ~11 August 2025
- Interdict filed 13 August 2025 (only **2 days later**)
- Last-minute manipulation of agreement terms
- "Has anything changed?" - "No, just details for attorneys" (false)

### 3. Investment Payout in 9 Months
- Major investment payout due May 2026
- Interdict filed 9 months before payout
- Suggests financial motive for gaining control

### 4. Peter's Transfer of Control to Rynette
- Non-director bookkeeper given unprecedented access
- All bank accounts, passwords, signatory authority
- Concurrent exclusion of directors
- Peter created the breakdown he now complains about

### 5. Peter's Own Unilateral Actions
- Cancelled all business cards (June 2025)
- Restricted director access to systems
- Characterized director oversight as "interference"
- Excluded Jax and Daniel from decision-making

### 6. Historical Collaborative Model
- RegimA businesses operated for years with informal, trust-based model
- Directors drew from loan accounts without formal board resolutions
- Peter participated in and benefited from this model
- Peter's sudden objection is inconsistent and pretextual

### 7. Director Loan Account Structure
- Directors maintain loan accounts with credit balances of several million rand
- Companies owe directors substantial sums at all times
- Peter himself received similar payments without board resolutions
- Peter's objection to R500K payment is hypocritical
