## üí° Key Insights

### 1. Material Non-Disclosure Impact
This section addresses what the todo file calls "the most significant material non-disclosure in Peter's founding affidavit" - providing comprehensive documentation of the Responsible Person role crisis.

### 2. Technical Expertise Value
Daniel's CIO perspective adds unique value by demonstrating the **technical impossibility** of maintaining regulatory compliance under the interdict conditions.

### 3. Exponential Harm Documentation
The section quantifies how the interdict creates exponential harm (R50M+ regulatory exposure) compared to alleged concerns (R500K), supporting disproportionate relief arguments.

### 4. Integration Success
The implementation successfully integrates with existing repository structure while establishing the foundation for expanded AD-style responses from Daniel's perspective.
