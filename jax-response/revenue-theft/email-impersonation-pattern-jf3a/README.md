## Cross-Reference with Related Evidence

### Connection to Category 4: Instruction Coordination
**Evidence Folder:** `20-june-gee-gayane-email/`  
**Timeline:** 2025-06-20

**Evidence Folder:** `29-may-domain-registration/`  
**Timeline:** 2025-05-29

**Coordinated Impersonation:**
- Son's domain registration for business impersonation
