- **Processing data outside approved systems:** Up to R10 million fine
- **Each individual violation:** Separate criminal offense
- **No defense:** "Following orders" provides no legal protection

### Compliance Facts Established

2. **RegimA Skin Treatments employees are unauthorized third parties** to this data
3. **Only Shopify has legal authorization** to process customer information  
4. **Alternative domains lack required security** and compliance measures

## Business Sabotage Documentation
### Systematic Operations Disruption
- **Shopify platform shutdown:** Eliminating authorized payment processing

## Employee Personal Criminal Liability Warning
The compliance directive specifically warns employees of their personal legal exposure:

LEGAL WARNING: These instructions are ILLEGAL and expose YOU to personal 
criminal prosecution.

YOUR PERSONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY
- Unauthorized access to customer data: 10 years imprisonment
- Processing data outside approved systems: R10 million fine

- "Following orders" is NOT a legal defence
```

### Mandatory Compliance Directive
**Employees MUST:**
- Process ALL orders through Shopify only
- Use ONLY official company domains  
- Report any requests to violate this directive

**Employees MUST NOT:**
- Access customer data on unauthorized systems
- Use personal or alternative domains
- Follow instructions that violate POPI

## Pete's Information Dependency Pattern
Consistent with case analysis showing **Peter Faucitt does not use a computer** and gets information from 3rd parties:

### Information Flow Analysis
- **Pete issues verbal instructions** to employees
- **Technical implementation** handled by intermediaries
- **Daniel discovers violations** through employee reports
- **Legal compliance directive** issued to protect employees

### Degrees of Separation Implications
- **Pete may not understand** full technical/legal implications
- **Intermediaries execute** without full legal awareness
- **Employees caught** between conflicting instructions
- **Legal liability cascades** to individual employees
