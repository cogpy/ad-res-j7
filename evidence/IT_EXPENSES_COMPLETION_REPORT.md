## Key Findings

### Industry Benchmark Analysis
- **RegimA IT Spend:** 10-11% of revenue
- **Industry Average (International E-commerce):** 8-15% of revenue
- **Assessment:** RegimA's IT expenses are within normal industry parameters
- **Conclusion:** RegimA is actually BELOW expected costs for similar operations

### Revenue Context
- Multi-year growth: R2M → R12M → R19M
- IT supporting R12-19M annual revenue operations
- International operations across 37 jurisdictions
- Regulated industry (cosmetics) with additional compliance requirements

### Documentation Gap Root Cause
Peter's own actions created the "missing documentation" problem:

1. **Mid-June 2025:** Daniel provides reports to accountant (cooperation)
2. **Next Day:** Peter secretly cancels all business cards (sabotage)
3. **June 2025:** Services halt, domains lapse, systems go down
4. **19 August 2025:** Ex parte interdict blocks system access completely

**Conclusion:** Peter prevented access to the very documents he now claims are missing.

## Evidence Annexures Referenced

All documentation supports the following evidence annexures:
- **JF5:** Schedule of IT expenses with invoices
- **JF5A:** Shopify Plus subscription invoices and usage reports
- **JF5B:** AWS/cloud hosting invoices and infrastructure diagrams
- **JF5C:** Microsoft 365 Business licenses for all staff
- **JF5D:** Adobe Creative Cloud subscription documentation
- **JF5E:** Sage accounting software invoices
- **JF5F:** Domain registrations and SSL certificates
- **JF5G:** Payment gateway fees (Stripe, PayPal, Peach Payments)
- **JF5H:** Comparative industry analysis showing IT spend as % of revenue
- **JF5I:** Technical architecture documentation justifying expenses

## Legal Assertions Supported

The documentation supports the following legal assertions:

1. ✅ All IT expenses are **fully justified** for international operations
2. ✅ All expenses are **properly documented** with invoices that existed before Peter's disruptions
3. ✅ Expenses are **industry-standard** and below expected costs for similar scale
4. ✅ Expenses are **essential** for regulatory compliance across 37 jurisdictions
5. ✅ Expenses are **necessary** for maintaining Responsible Person role and market access
6. ✅ Peter's "unexplained" characterization is **demonstrably false**
7. ✅ Peter's own actions **created the documentation gap** he now complains about

## Technical Justification Provided

- Regulatory compliance infrastructure (37 jurisdictions)
- GDPR data localization requirements (EU data in EU)
- PCI-DSS payment security compliance
- Product safety database (Responsible Person role)
- Multi-jurisdictional tax calculation systems
