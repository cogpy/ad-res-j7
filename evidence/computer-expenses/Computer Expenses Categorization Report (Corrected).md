## Methodology

### Data Collection and Processing

The analysis was performed on four CSV files containing historical transaction data:
- AccountTransactionsReport.csv
- AccountTransactionsReport(1).csv
- AccountTransactionsReport(2).csv
- AccountTransactionsReport(3).csv

These files were combined, cleaned, and standardized to create a unified dataset with consistent date formats, numeric values, and text fields. Duplicate transactions were identified and marked.

### Categorization Framework

Transactions were categorized using a comprehensive framework based on keywords in the Description, Reference, and Bank/Customer/Supplier fields. The categorization was performed in multiple stages:

1. Initial categorization using primary category keywords
2. Refinement with additional category identification
3. Validation and correction of potential miscategorizations
4. Final category assignment

The framework includes 18 distinct categories aligned with business functions and SARS audit requirements.
