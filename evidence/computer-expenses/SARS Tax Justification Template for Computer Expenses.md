# SARS Tax Justification Template for Computer Expenses

## Overview
This template provides a structured framework for justifying computer expenses from the South African Revenue Service (SARS) perspective as being "in the production of income." This justification is essential for ensuring that claimed expenses meet tax deductibility requirements and can withstand scrutiny during a SARS audit.

## Tax Deductibility Requirements

### General Principles
According to Section 11(a) of the Income Tax Act, for an expense to be tax-deductible, it must be:
1. **Actually incurred:** The expense must have been paid or legally obligated to be paid
2. **During the year of assessment:** The expense must relate to the current tax year
3. **In the production of income:** The expense must be directly related to income-generating activities
4. **Not of a capital nature:** The expense must not create an enduring benefit (with exceptions)
5. **Trade requirement:** The expense must be incurred in carrying on a trade

### Computer Expenses Specific Considerations
For computer expenses specifically, SARS will evaluate:
1. **Business purpose:** Clear business purpose rather than personal use
2. **Necessity:** Whether the expense is necessary for business operations
3. **Reasonableness:** Whether the amount spent is reasonable for the business size and needs
4. **Documentation:** Proper invoices, contracts, and business purpose documentation
5. **Consistency:** Consistent treatment of similar expenses over time
