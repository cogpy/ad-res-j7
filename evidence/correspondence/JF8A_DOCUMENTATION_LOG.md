# JF8A: Detailed Log of All Documentation Provided to Peter

**Case:** 2025-137857 - Peter Faucitt v. Jacqueline Faucitt et al.  
**Annexure:** JF8A (JF-CORR1)  
**Date Prepared:** 2025-10-14  
**Purpose:** Critical Evidence - Documentation provision log to counter Peter's "unexplained" allegations

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive, chronological log of ALL documentation, reports, records, and information provided to Peter Faucitt (the Applicant) or his representatives during the period leading up to his ex parte interdict application on 13 August 2025.

**Key Finding:** The characterization of expenses and transactions as "unexplained" or "lacking documentation" is **demonstrably false**. Daniel Faucitt cooperated fully with all legitimate requests for information, providing comprehensive reports to the accountant Mr. Bantjes in mid-June 2025. The subsequent "documentation gap" was created entirely by Peter's own unilateral actions in restricting access to systems containing the documentation.

### 2.3 Why Documentation "Gap" Exists

**The "gap" is entirely Peter's creation:**

1. **Mid-June 2025:** Daniel provides comprehensive reports to Bantjes (cooperation)
2. **Day after reports provided:** Peter secretly cancels all business bank cards (sabotage)
3. **June-July 2025:** IT services halt, domains lapse, systems go offline (manufactured crisis)
4. **June-July 2025:** Peter restricts Daniel's access to documentation systems (obstruction)
5. **June-July 2025:** Peter demands detailed invoices Daniel cannot access (entrapment)
6. **19 August 2025:** Ex parte interdict blocks all system access (completion of obstruction)

**Result:** Peter prevented access to the very documents he now claims are missing.

**Evidence Required:**
- [ ] **JF-SAL1**: System access restriction logs showing Peter excluded Daniel
- [ ] **JF-EAL1**: Email access restriction logs
- [ ] **JF-FSL1**: Financial system access restriction logs
- [ ] **JF-CANCEL-DATE**: Documentation of card cancellation date

   - Court not told Peter created the "documentation gap"

4. **Daniel provided available documentation despite restrictions**

---

## Section 10: Conclusion and Strategic Significance

### 10.1 Summary of Documentation Provided

**What Daniel Provided:**
✅ Comprehensive business reports to accountant (June 6, 2025)  
✅ Fraud and theft reports to trustee (June 10, 2025)  
✅ IT expense documentation (available despite restrictions)  
✅ Bank records and transaction details (within access constraints)  
✅ Historical context and business practice evidence  
✅ Regulatory compliance documentation  
✅ Full cooperation with legitimate oversight requests  

**What Peter Did:**
❌ Cancelled cards without warning (created crisis)  
❌ Restricted system access (prevented documentation)  
❌ Demanded inaccessible information (entrapment)  
❌ Characterized cooperation as "unexplained" (bad faith)  
❌ Concealed his own participation in same practices (inconsistency)  
❌ Misled court about Daniel's cooperation (material non-disclosure)  

---

### 10.2 The "Unexplained" Characterization is False

**Three-Part Proof:**

1. **Documentation exists:** All IT expenses are legitimate, documented, and industry-standard
2. **Documentation was provided:** Daniel provided comprehensive reports in June 2025
3. **Documentation gap is Peter's creation:** Card cancellations and system restrictions made comprehensive response impossible

**Conclusion:** Peter cannot restrict access to documentation systems, then claim documentation doesn't exist, and use that as a basis for allegations of financial misconduct.

---

### 10.3 Strategic Value for Affidavit

**This log establishes:**
- Daniel's full cooperation with legitimate oversight
- Peter's creation of the "documentation problem"
- Peter's material non-disclosure to court
- Peter's inconsistent position (accepted same practices for years)

**Recommended Use:**
- Annexure JF8A (or JF-CORR1) to answering affidavit
- Reference in response to "unexplained transactions" allegations
- Evidence of Peter's contradictory conduct
- Proof of material non-disclosure warranting setting aside interim order
