# Accounting Records - Director Loan Account Allocation
## Case 2025-137857
## Annexure JF-AR1 / JF7D

---

## Document Purpose

This document provides accounting records demonstrating proper allocation of transactions to director loan accounts for RegimA businesses, with specific focus on the R500,000 payment dated 16 July 2025.

## Background

The RegimA businesses maintain director loan accounts for all directors in accordance with standard accounting practices for close corporations and private companies. These accounts track amounts owed by the companies to directors (credit balances) and amounts owed by directors to the companies (debit balances).

---

## 1. Director Loan Account Structure

### 1.1 Accounting Framework

Director loan accounts operate under the following principles:

1. **Credit Balance (Company owes Director)**: When directors advance funds to the company, pay company expenses personally, or provide services without immediate compensation
2. **Debit Balance (Director owes Company)**: When directors withdraw funds, receive payments, or take distributions
3. **Reconciliation**: Regular accounting reconciliation ensures all transactions are properly allocated
4. **Tax Treatment**: Director loan accounts are tax-neutral; they represent inter-company/director obligations rather than income or expenses

### 1.2 Transaction Processing Method

For the RegimA businesses, director loan account transactions are processed as follows:

1. **Bank Reference Method**: Transactions are marked on bank statements with clear references (e.g., "Director Loan - Daniel", "DL - Peter", "Director withdrawal - Jax")
2. **Automatic Allocation**: Bank feed integration with accounting software (Sage) automatically allocates transactions based on reference coding
3. **Monthly Reconciliation**: Accountant reviews and reconciles all director loan account transactions monthly
4. **No Board Resolution Requirement**: For routine director loan account transactions, formal board resolutions are not required under the established practice of these close corporations

## 2. Director Loan Account Balances

### 2.1 Summary of Director Loan Account Positions

As of 16 July 2025 (before the R500,000 payment):

| Director | Credit Balance | Notes |

1. **Personal Expenses for Company Business**: Directors paying company expenses from personal funds
2. **Advances to Company**: Directors lending money to the company for working capital
3. **Unpaid Director Fees**: Director remuneration not immediately withdrawn
4. **IT Infrastructure Costs**: Particularly for Daniel Faucitt, personal payment of IT services (documented in JF7)
