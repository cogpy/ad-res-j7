**Note:** Peter's figures include additional one-time costs, development, consulting, and other technology expenses beyond these core categories.

## Why These Expenses Are Legitimate

1. **International Operations:** 37 jurisdictions require substantial compliance infrastructure
2. **Regulatory Compliance:** GDPR, PCI-DSS, EU Regulation 1223/2009
3. **Revenue Scale:** Supporting R12-19M annual revenue operations
4. **Industry Standard:** 10-11% IT spend is within normal 8-15% range
5. **Responsible Person Role:** Legally mandated systems for international market access

## Why Documentation Gap Exists

Peter's own actions created the "missing documentation" problem:

1. **Mid-June 2025:** Daniel provides reports to accountant (cooperation)
2. **Next Day:** Peter secretly cancels all business cards (sabotage)
3. **June 2025:** Services halt, domains lapse, systems go down
4. **19 August 2025:** Ex parte interdict blocks system access completely

**Result:** Peter prevented access to the very documents he now claims are missing.

## Industry Comparison

**E-commerce IT Spending Benchmarks:**
- Basic e-commerce: 5-8% of revenue
- Multi-store operations: 8-12% of revenue
- International (multi-jurisdiction): 10-15% of revenue
- Regulated industries: +2-5% additional

**RegimA Profile:**
- Multi-store international operations ✓
- 37 jurisdictions ✓
- Regulated industry (cosmetics) ✓
- Expected range: 12-17% of revenue

**RegimA Actual:** 10-11% of revenue = **BELOW expected for similar operations**

## Conclusion

All IT expenses are:
- ✅ **Justified:** Required for international operations
- ✅ **Documented:** Invoices existed before Peter's disruptions
- ✅ **Industry-standard:** Below expected costs for similar scale
- ✅ **Essential:** Regulatory compliance and revenue generation
- ✅ **Legitimate:** Authorized business expenses

The "unexplained" characterization is **demonstrably false**.
