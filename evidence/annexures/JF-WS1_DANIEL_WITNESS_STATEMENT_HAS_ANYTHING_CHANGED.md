## STATEMENT OF DANIEL FAUCITT

I, **DANIEL FAUCITT**, do hereby make oath and state that:

### 1. BACKGROUND AND CAPACITY

1.1 I am the Second Respondent in the above-mentioned case.

1.2 I am a UK citizen and tax resident of the United Kingdom.

1.3 The facts contained in this statement are within my personal knowledge and are true and correct.

1.4 I was present during the signing of the JF5 settlement agreement on or about 11 August 2025.

### 2. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT CONTEXT

2.1 The settlement agreement (JF5) was presented as covering psychiatric evaluations and drug screening.

2.2 We understood this to be a private voluntary agreement to accommodate jurisdictional limitations as UK citizens.

2.3 We had conducted a final review of the agreement before signing.

2.4 After our final review, the attorneys stated they needed to "check with the Applicant" and then returned with documents for signing.

### 3. THE CRITICAL EXCHANGE

**3.1 THE QUESTION**

When presented with the final documents for signature, I specifically asked:

**"Has anything changed?"**

**3.2 THE RESPONSE** 

The attorneys responded:

**"No, we just added the details for the attorneys."**

**3.3 MY INTERPRETATION**

Based on this response, I interpreted the changes to be:
- Administrative contact information 
- Clerical additions such as attorney names and contact details
- Administrative "details" that would not affect the substance of the agreement
- Minor additions necessary for administrative purposes

**3.4 RELIANCE ON THE MISREPRESENTATION**

3.4.1 I relied on this representation when deciding to sign the agreement.

3.4.2 I would not have signed the agreement if I had known the actual extent of the changes.

3.4.3 The representation was a material factor in my decision to proceed with signing.

### 4. THE ACTUAL CHANGES (DISCOVERED LATER)

4.1 I subsequently discovered that the following fundamental changes had been made without disclosure:

#### 4.1.1 Control Transfer Changes:
- Every instance of "parties" was changed to "parties' attorneys"
- Control over selection of professionals was transferred from the parties themselves to their attorneys
- The agreement granted attorneys unilateral control over professional selection

#### 4.1.2 Jurisdictional Changes:
- The reference to the Gauteng Family Law Forum was **removed entirely** from the final version
- This directly contradicted our expressed jurisdictional concerns as UK residents

#### 4.1.3 Evidence of Manipulation:
- Evidence of copy-paste errors (duplicate cost clauses) indicating hurried manipulation
- Systematic replacement of terms throughout the document
- Changes that fundamentally altered the nature and control structure of the agreement

### 5. MATERIALITY OF THE MISREPRESENTATION

5.1 **The changes were NOT "just details for attorneys"** as represented.

5.2 **The changes fundamentally altered:**
- Who controls the selection of professionals
- The jurisdictional framework of the agreement  
- The nature of our participation and consent

5.3 **These changes directly affected:**
- Our ability to participate meaningfully in the process
- Our jurisdictional concerns as UK residents
- The balance of control in the agreement

### 6. IMPACT AND DAMAGES

6.1 **Immediate Impact:**
- I was induced to sign an agreement I would have refused if properly informed
- The misrepresentation led directly to my consent being obtained through fraud

6.2 **Subsequent Legal Impact:**
- The fraudulently obtained agreement was used as justification for the interdict
- This has caused significant business and financial harm
- The fraud in the inducement undermines the entire basis of the Applicant's case

### 7. LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE

7.1 This exchange demonstrates **fraud in the inducement** because:
- Material changes were made without disclosure
- Specific misrepresentations were made about the nature of changes
- I relied on these misrepresentations when consenting
- The misrepresentations were material to my decision

7.2 The agreement obtained through this fraudulent process cannot serve as valid justification for the interdict.

### 8. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

8.1 This statement should be read together with:
- **JF5 Draft Agreement** (original version reviewed)
- **JF5 Final Agreement** (signed version with undisclosed changes)
- **JF5 Comparison Document** highlighting all changes between draft and final
- **Affidavit Paragraphs 48.3-48.7** detailing the manipulation

8.2 The pattern of changes evidences systematic manipulation rather than administrative additions.

---

## CONCLUSION

The "Has anything changed?" - "No, just details for attorneys" exchange was a material misrepresentation that induced my consent to an agreement I would have refused if properly informed. This fraudulent inducement undermines the entire basis of the Applicant's interdict application.
