- **No demand** for procedural changes
- **Continued use** of identical process for subsequent withdrawals
- **Active participation** in business operations using same informal procedures

**Evidence of Knowledge and Acceptance:**

---

## COMPARATIVE TIMELINE ANALYSIS

### Historical Pattern vs. Current Objection:

**Peter's Historical Position (Demonstrated by Actions):**
- **[Date of this withdrawal]:** Used identical process, no objection
- **[Other historical dates]:** Continued using same process
- **[Years of pattern]:** Never complained about informal procedures
- **[Settlement context begins]:** Settlement negotiations intensify
- **16 July 2025:** Daniel uses identical process
- **[Attorney consultation date]:** Peter suddenly consults attorney
- **[Days later]:** Peter files complaint about "identical" process

**Analysis:**
- **Years of acceptance** → **Sudden objection** = **Suspicious timing**
- **Identical process** → **Selective enforcement** = **Hypocritical position**
- **Personal benefit** → **Others' detriment** = **Strategic weaponization**

### 1. Directly Exposes Peter's Hypocrisy

**Demonstrates:**
- **Peter used identical process** for his own benefit

- **Consistent application** across all directors

### 3. Establishes Peter's Knowledge and Acceptance

**Evidence of:**
- **Informed consent** to informal procedures (by participation)
- **Active benefit** from the same system he now attacks
- **Historical acceptance** negates current objection
- **Estoppel principle** - Peter cannot deny what he previously accepted

### 4. Supports Pretext Argument

**Timeline evidence:**

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This annexure must demonstrate Peter's use of the identical process he now claims is unauthorized.

This is one of four examples (JF-PA1 to JF-PA4) that collectively prove Peter's contradictory position.
