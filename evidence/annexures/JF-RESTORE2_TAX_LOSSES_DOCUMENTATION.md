## STRATEGIC VALUE ASSESSMENT

### **Current Financial Value of Preserved Losses:**

**Corporation Tax Rate Analysis:**
- **Current Rate (2025):** 25% for profits over £250,000
- **Small Company Rate:** 19% for profits under £50,000
- **Marginal Relief:** Available between thresholds

**Value Calculation:**
**Scenario 1 - Small Company Rate (19%):**
£650,000 × 19% = **£123,500 tax saving**

**Scenario 2 - Main Rate (25%):**
£650,000 × 25% = **£162,500 tax saving**

**Net Present Value:** Assuming 5% discount rate and 5-year utilization = **£95,000-£127,000**

### **Alternative Scenarios Analysis:**

#### If Peter's Abandonment Had Succeeded:
**Liquidation Scenario:**
- **Tax Losses:** Complete loss (£650,000+ destroyed)
- **Value Destroyed:** £123,500-£162,500 in tax benefits
- **Creditor Recovery:** £0 (no ongoing business to generate repayments)
- **Future Potential:** £0 (company dissolved)

#### Daniel's Preservation Strategy:
**Dormant Preservation Scenario:**
- **Tax Losses:** 100% preserved (£650,000+)
- **Value Protected:** £123,500-£162,500 in tax benefits
- **Creditor Recovery:** Ongoing gradual repayments from new ventures
- **Future Potential:** Full restoration to trading status possible

**Net Value Creation by Daniel:** £123,500-£162,500 + ongoing creditor repayments + future trading potential
