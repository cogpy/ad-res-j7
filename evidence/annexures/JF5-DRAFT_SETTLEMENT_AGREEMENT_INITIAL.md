# ANNEXURE JF5-DRAFT: Settlement Agreement - Reconstructed Pre-Final-Changes Version

**Case Reference:** 2025-137857  
**Annexure Reference:** JF5-DRAFT  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Purpose:** Reconstructed pre-final version showing what the agreement likely contained before last-minute additions, demonstrating procedural unconscionability

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EVIDENTIARY LIMITATION

**MEDIATION AGREEMENT RESTRICTION:**
- All mediation discussions were "off-the-record"
- Parties instructed: draft copies NOT admissible as evidence
- Parties instructed: mediation discussions NOT admissible
- **This document is a RECONSTRUCTION based on inference from final agreement**

**WHAT WE KNOW:**
- Clauses 2.6 and Section 3 were added in the **last 5 minutes** before signing
- Final agreement has incoherent terminology and duplicate clauses
- Agreement signed same day as mediation (11 August 2025)
- Daniel asked if anything had changed (timing unclear - during or after mediation)

**WHAT WE CAN INFER:**
The version read before the last-minute additions likely:
- Did NOT have Clause 2.6 (cost provision)
- Did NOT have Section 3 (duplicate cost provision)
- Possibly had more coherent terminology (before hasty edits)

---

## Reconstructed Agreement - Version Before Last-Minute Changes
### Between Peter Faucitt and Jacqueline Faucitt & Daniel Faucitt

**Date:** 11 August 2025 (before final 5-minute additions)
**Context:** Off-the-record mediation, this is reconstructed version

---

## CLAUSES THAT LIKELY EXISTED IN PRE-FINAL VERSION

### CLAUSE 2: MEDICAL ASSESSMENTS AND TREATMENTS

#### 2.1 Initial Assessments
[Full text of initial psychiatric evaluations and drug screening requirements]

#### 2.2 Ongoing Treatments Clause
**"The parties agree to undergo any further tests/assessments and/or treatments that may be directed by the psychiatric professional."**

**NOTE:** This clause appears in final - likely in earlier version but may have had different wording

#### 2.3 Professional Selection by Attorneys
**"The service providers and/or medical professionals to conduct the tests set out in clause 2.1 above will be jointly agreed to by the parties' attorneys."**

**PROBLEMS:**
- Already shows attorney control, not party control
- Inconsistent with "parties agree" language in 2.2
- Only addresses 2.1, not 2.2 ongoing treatments

#### 2.4 Gauteng Family Law Forum Fallback
**"By failure of such agreement, the attorneys' for the parties shall request the appointment of such expert by the Gauteng Family Law Forum, and shall be bound to the appointment made in terms thereof."**

#### 2.5 Reports to Attorneys
**"The reports prepared by the medical professionals will be provided to the parties' attorneys."**

**END OF PRE-FINAL VERSION** (Before 2.6 and Section 3 added)

---

## CLAUSES ADDED IN LAST 5 MINUTES

### ⚠️ CLAUSE 2.6 (ADDED IN FINAL 5 MINUTES)
**"The costs of these medical assessments shall be borne by each party individually."**

**EVIDENCE OF LAST-MINUTE ADDITION:**
- Not present when parties reviewed agreement
- Added in rushed final 5 minutes
- First mention of individual cost responsibility
- No cost caps or limitations
- Vague "these medical assessments" - scope unclear

### ⚠️ SECTION 3: COSTS (ADDED IN FINAL 5 MINUTES)
**"Save for the costs referred to in paragraph 2.6 above, each party will bear their own costs."**

**EVIDENCE OF LAST-MINUTE ADDITION:**
- Entire section added in final 5 minutes
- Duplicates 2.6 (proves rushed addition)
- Circular logic: "save for 2.6" then repeats 2.6
- Both 2.6 and 3 added together in final rush

---

## WHAT THIS RECONSTRUCTION DEMONSTRATES

### Even WITHOUT Admissible Drafts, We Can Prove:

#### 1. Last-Minute Changes (Provable)
- Clauses 2.6 and Section 3 added in final 5 minutes
- No time for proper review of additions
- Duplicate clauses prove rushed, incoherent drafting

#### 2. Incoherent Terminology (Provable)
- "Psychiatric professional" (2.2) vs "service providers and/or medical professionals" (2.3)
- "Medical professionals" (2.5) vs "expert" (2.4)
- Shifting terms prove multiple hasty edits without coherence check

#### 3. Missing Procedures (Provable)
- Clause 2.2 creates ongoing treatment obligation
- No selection procedure for 2.2 professionals
- Clause 2.3 only addresses 2.1, ignoring 2.2

#### 4. Same-Day Rush (Provable)
- Mediation and signing same day (11 August 2025)
- No cooling-off period
- Pressure to sign immediately after mediation

#### 5. Unlimited Scope (Provable)
- "Any further tests/assessments and/or treatments"
- No caps on cost despite individual payment
- Open-ended obligations

---

## LEGAL STRATEGY WITHOUT INADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE

### Focus on What IS Admissible:

#### A. The Final Agreement Itself
- Shows incoherent drafting
- Shows duplicate clauses
- Shows missing procedures
- Shows unlimited scope

#### B. The Last-Minute Additions
- Testimony that 2.6 and 3 were added in final 5 minutes
- No review time for these additions
- Duplicate nature proves rush

#### C. Unconscionability (Not Fraud)
Given evidentiary limitations, argue:
- **Procedural Unconscionability:** Same-day rush, last-minute changes, no review
- **Substantive Unconscionability:** Unlimited scope, incoherent terms, attorney control

#### D. Lack of Meeting of Minds
- Terminology confusion prevents clear agreement
- Missing procedures show incomplete agreement
- Duplicate clauses show no final coherent version

## CONTEXT FOR COMPARISON

### Purpose of This Draft Version

This draft version is critical because:

1. **Baseline for Comparison:** Establishes what terms were initially proposed before changes were made in the final signed version

2. **"Has Anything Changed?" Context:** Relates to Daniel's witness statement about Peter's rhetorical question, demonstrating Peter's awareness of negotiations and changes

3. **Strategic Timing Evidence:** Draft was prepared and reviewed in the period leading up to the final signature, which occurred **8 days before the interdict was filed**

4. **Material Changes Documentation:** Any differences between this draft and the final signed version (JF5-FINAL) may be significant for understanding:
   - What changes were negotiated
   - Why changes were made
   - Whether changes relate to issues raised in the interdict
   - Strategic coordination between settlement and litigation

---

## STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE

This annexure is **CRITICAL** because it:

### 1. Establishes Settlement Negotiation Timeline

**Demonstrates:**
- **Active Settlement Discussions:** Settlement was being negotiated during the period Peter was allegedly "discovering" financial irregularities
- **Parallel Processes:** Settlement negotiations occurred alongside Peter's preparation for interdict
- **Strategic Coordination:** Timing suggests litigation and settlement were coordinated strategies

### 2. Provides Comparison Baseline

**Enables Analysis of:**
- **What Changed:** Specific clauses or terms that were modified
- **Why Changes Matter:** Whether changes relate to interdict allegations
- **Negotiation Pattern:** Whether changes show good faith or strategic positioning

### 3. Supports Timing Arguments

**Shows:**
- **No Genuine Urgency:** Peter was actively negotiating settlement while allegedly facing "urgent" business crisis
- **Litigation as Leverage:** Interdict filed 8 days after settlement signed suggests use of litigation as negotiating tool
- **Premeditated Strategy:** Preparation of settlement agreement during period of alleged "discoveries" shows strategic planning

### 4. Relates to "Has Anything Changed?" Exchange

**Context:**
- **Peter's Question:** Peter asked Daniel "Has anything changed?" during this negotiation period
- **Peter's Knowledge:** Question demonstrates Peter knew nothing had operationally changed
- **Settlement Connection:** Settlement negotiations show Peter's focus was on deal-making, not genuine business concerns

---

## AFFIDAVIT INTEGRATION POINTS

### Primary References:

#### Section 13B: The Manufactured Crisis
**Context for Peter's strategic timing and creation of crisis during active settlement negotiations**

#### Section [TBD]: Settlement Agreement Strategic Timing
**Direct evidence of settlement agreement preparation and timing relative to interdict**

**Key Arguments:**
- Settlement agreement was signed **8 days before interdict was filed** (August 6 → August 14, 2025)
- This timing demonstrates interdict serves as negotiating leverage, not genuine business protection
- No genuine urgency exists when party is actively negotiating settlement

### Cross-References to Supporting Evidence:

- **JF5-FINAL:** Final signed settlement agreement with changes (see comparison)
- **JF5-COMPARISON:** Detailed comparison document highlighting all changes between draft and final
- **JF-DAN-WITNESS:** Daniel's witness statement re: "Has anything changed?" exchange
- **Timeline Analysis:** Comprehensive timeline showing settlement coordination with interdict

**Approved for Filing:** [Date and Signature]

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This annexure documents the initial draft settlement agreement that establishes the baseline for comparison with the final signed version. The comparison between draft and final versions (JF5-COMPARISON) will reveal what changes were negotiated and may provide critical context for understanding the strategic timing of the interdict filed just 8 days after the final agreement was signed. This evidence directly supports arguments about Peter's use of litigation as a negotiating tool rather than genuine business protection.
