# ANNEXURE JF-PA3: PETER'S WITHDRAWAL EXAMPLE 3

**Case Reference:** 2025-137857  
**Annexure Reference:** JF-PA3  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Date:** [To be completed]  
**Purpose:** Third example of Peter Faucitt's identical withdrawal demonstrating sustained pattern and establishing his conduct as creating legitimate business practice

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Key Evidence Elements:

1. **Peter's Third Transaction** ([Date])
2. **Sustained Pattern Confirmation** (Third instance of identical process)
3. **Legal Precedent Creation** (Pattern establishes business practice)
4. **Timing Analysis** (Proximity to disputed transaction or settlement context)
5. **Amount Significance** (Scale comparable to or exceeding disputed amount)

## PATTERN SOLIDIFICATION ANALYSIS

### Third Instance Significance:

**Legal Precedent Principles:**
- **First Instance (PA1):** Could be accident or mistake
- **Second Instance (PA2):** Shows intentional repetition
- **Third Instance (PA3):** **Establishes deliberate pattern and business practice**
- **Subsequent Instances:** Reinforce established precedent

**Business Practice Creation:**
- **Consistent repetition** creates legitimate business practice
- **Peter's conduct** established the precedent for informal procedures
- **Other directors' reliance** on Peter's demonstrated acceptance
- **Mutual understanding** through sustained practice

### Cumulative Timeline Evidence:

**[PLACEHOLDER: Insert timeline analysis]**

**Peter's Pattern Establishment:**
- **[PA1 Date]:** First use - Initial acceptance
- **[PA2 Date]:** Second use - Intentional repetition  
- **[PA3 Date]:** Third use - **Pattern establishment**
- **[Additional dates]:** Continued reinforcement
- **[Settlement context begins]:** External pressure emerges
- **16 July 2025:** Daniel uses **identical established process**
- **[Attorney consultation]:** Peter seeks strategic advantage
- **[Filing date]:** Peter suddenly objects to **his own established practice**

## LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF PATTERN

### Business Practice Establishment:

**Legal Criteria for Established Business Practice:**
1. **Consistency:** ✓ Identical process across multiple transactions
2. **Duration:** ✓ Sustained over time with multiple instances  
3. **Acceptance:** ✓ Peter's voluntary and repeated participation
4. **Reliance:** ✓ Other directors structured conduct accordingly
5. **Mutual Understanding:** ✓ All parties operated under same assumptions

**Peter's Role as Practice Creator:**
- **Primary author** of informal procedure through his conduct
- **Leading example** followed by other directors
- **Active participant** in establishing mutual understanding
- **Cannot deny** what he himself created and sustained

### Estoppel and Waiver Strengthened:

**Three-Transaction Evidence Creates:**
- **Unambiguous waiver** of formal procedure requirements
- **Clear representation** that informal process is acceptable
- **Reasonable reliance basis** for other directors
- **Detrimental change** if Peter now permitted to object

---

## STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE

This annexure **PROVIDES DECISIVE EVIDENCE** by:

### 1. Establishing Unambiguous Pattern

**Three Instances Create:**
- **Legal certainty** that Peter's conduct was intentional, not accidental
- **Business practice precedent** that cannot be disputed
- **Reasonable reliance basis** for other directors' conduct
- **Estoppel foundation** preventing Peter's current objection

### 2. Demonstrating Peter's Leadership in Creating Practice

**Peter as Practice Architect:**
- **Created precedent** through repeated voluntary conduct
- **Established expectations** for other directors
- **Led by example** in implementing informal procedures
- **Cannot disavow** his own creation

### 3. Proving Sustained Acceptance Over Time

**Long-term Commitment:**
- **Not experimental** - sustained commitment to informal process
- **Not circumstantial** - consistent across different contexts
- **Not ignorant** - full knowledge through repeated experience
- **Not coerced** - voluntary and self-initiated pattern

### 4. Creating Legal Barrier to Current Objection

**Legal Principles Applied:**
- **Estoppel:** Peter cannot deny what he established
- **Waiver:** Peter voluntarily relinquished right to object
- **Course of Dealing:** Established pattern governs future transactions
- **Good Faith:** Peter's sudden objection violates good faith principles
