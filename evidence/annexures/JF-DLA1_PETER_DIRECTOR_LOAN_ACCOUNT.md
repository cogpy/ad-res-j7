## STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE

This annexure is **CRITICAL** because it:

### 1. Exposes Peter's Hypocrisy

**Demonstrates:**
- Peter made **identical withdrawals** for **years** using the **same process**
- Peter **never complained** about this process when he benefited from it
- Peter's current objection is **selective and opportunistic**

### 2. Establishes Long-Standing Accepted Practice

**Proves:**
- Director loan withdrawals were **routine and accepted** for **years**

- **Identical process** used by all directors consistently
- **Mutual understanding** and acceptance of informal procedure

### 3. Demonstrates Financial Legitimacy

**Shows:**
- **Current credit balance** = RegimA owes Peter money (not the reverse)
- **Proper accounting treatment** = full compliance with accounting standards

- **Multi-year history** = sustained, legitimate business practice

### 4. Supports Pretext Argument

**Evidence indicates:**

- Peter's allegation is **inconsistent** with his own conduct
- Peter is **weaponizing normal business practices** for strategic advantage
