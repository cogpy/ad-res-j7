**Annexure Reference:** JF-PA2  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Date:** [To be completed]  
**Purpose:** Second example of Peter Faucitt's identical withdrawal demonstrating consistent pattern of using the same process he now claims was unauthorized

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

2. **Consistent Pattern** (Same process as JF-PA1 and 16 July 2025)
3. **Repeated Acceptance** (Multiple instances of no objection)
4. **Amount and Context** (Comparable to disputed transaction)
5. **Timing Context** (Historical vs. current objection)

## REINFORCED PATTERN EVIDENCE

### Multiple Transaction Analysis:

**Peter's Established Pattern (PA1 + PA2 + Additional):**

| Transaction | Date | Amount | Method | Objection | Time to Current Complaint |
|------------|------|--------|---------|-----------|-------------------------|
| **JF-PA1** | [Date] | R[Amount] | [Method] | **NONE** | [Years/Months] |
| **JF-PA2** | [Date] | R[Amount] | [Method] | **NONE** | [Years/Months] |
| **[Others]** | [Dates] | R[Amounts] | [Method] | **NONE** | [Years/Months] |
| **Daniel's** | 16 Jul 2025 | R500,000 | [Method] | **SUDDEN OBJECTION** | Immediate |

**Pattern Analysis:**
- **Multiple instances** of Peter's comfortable use of identical process
- **Years of acceptance** with no complaints or objections
- **Consistent methodology** across all Peter's transactions
- **Sudden change** in position only when Daniel benefits

### Cumulative Evidence of Acceptance:

**Demonstrated Through Actions:**
1. **First Use (PA1):** Initial acceptance of informal process
2. **Repeated Use (PA2):** Confirmation of ongoing acceptance
3. **Continued Use:** [Additional instances demonstrate pattern]
4. **No Modifications Requested:** Never sought procedural changes
5. **Active Participation:** Continued business operations using same framework

## LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

### Estoppel Principles:

**Peter's Conduct Creates Legal Estoppel:**
- **Representation by conduct:** Peter's repeated use represents acceptance
- **Reliance by others:** Other directors relied on Peter's demonstrated acceptance
- **Detrimental change:** Others structured their conduct based on Peter's acceptance
- **Inequity of denial:** Unfair for Peter to deny what he previously established

### Waiver of Objection:

**Peter's Pattern Demonstrates Waiver:**
- **Voluntary relinquishment** of right to object to informal procedures
- **Knowledge of right** (Peter could have demanded board resolutions)
- **Intentional conduct** (repeated use shows intentional waiver)
- **Reasonable reliance** by others on Peter's waiver

---

## STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE

This annexure **STRENGTHENS THE CASE** by:

### 1. Reinforcing Pattern Evidence

**Multiple Examples:**
- **JF-PA1:** First example of Peter's hypocrisy
- **JF-PA2:** Second example reinforcing pattern
- **JF-PA3 & JF-PA4:** Additional examples creating overwhelming evidence
- **Collective Impact:** Impossible to dismiss as isolated incident

### 2. Demonstrating Sustained Acceptance

**Long-term Pattern:**
- **Not accidental:** Multiple uses show intentional acceptance
- **Not ignorant:** Repeated use demonstrates knowledge of process
- **Not coerced:** Voluntary and continuing use
- **Not circumstantial:** Consistent behavior across different contexts

### 3. Supporting Pretext Argument

**Timeline Evidence:**
- **Years of comfortable use** followed by **sudden objection**
- **No intervening change** in circumstances or procedures
- **Timing correlation** with settlement negotiations
- **Selective enforcement** based on who benefits

### 4. Establishing Business Practice

**Precedent Creation:**
- **Peter's conduct established precedent** for informal procedures
- **Other directors reasonably relied** on Peter's demonstrated acceptance
- **Mutual understanding** created through consistent practice
- **Legitimate expectation** that same process would continue

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This second example strengthens the pattern evidence and makes it impossible for Peter to claim his use of the informal process was accidental or isolated. The accumulating evidence of repeated acceptance supports both the hypocrisy argument and the legal principles of estoppel and waiver.
