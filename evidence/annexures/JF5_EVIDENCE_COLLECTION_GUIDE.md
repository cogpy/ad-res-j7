# JF5 Settlement Agreement Evidence Collection Guide

**Case Reference:** 2025-137857  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** Templates Created - Evidence Collection Required  
**Created:** October 2025

---

## Purpose

This guide provides instructions for collecting and completing the JF5 settlement agreement evidence annexures that are essential for establishing fraud in the inducement in the responding affidavit.

---

## Background

The settlement agreement (referred to as "JF5" in the affidavit) was signed on 11 August 2025, two days before Peter Faucitt filed his ex parte interdict application. Critical evidence exists showing that:

1. **Material changes were made** to the agreement after Jacqueline and Daniel Faucitt completed their review
2. **These changes were concealed** through the false statement "No, just details for attorneys"
3. **The changes were highly material**, including:
   - Transfer of control from parties to attorneys
   - Addition of "Gauteng Family Law Forum" framework
   - Expansion of scope from evaluation to treatments
4. **Signatures were procured by fraud in the inducement**

---

- Quantification of material vs. administrative changes
- Legal basis for fraud in the inducement claim

**Required to Complete:**
- [ ] Obtain both JF5-DRAFT and JF5-FINAL documents

## Evidence Collection Checklist

### Phase 1: Document Location

**Location 1: ENS Africa Email Correspondence**
- [ ] Search emails from ENS Africa dated August 2025

- [ ] Look for final agreement or signing appointment notice (11 August)
- [ ] Preserve email metadata (date, time, subject, attachments)

**Location 2: Personal Files**
- [ ] Check if respondents retained copy of draft version
- [ ] Check if respondents retained copy of signed version
- [ ] Verify dates and versions

**Location 3: ENS Africa Official Request**
- [ ] Formally request copy of draft agreement sent for review
- [ ] Formally request copy of signed settlement agreement
- [ ] Request any version history or track changes documents
- [ ] Request correspondence related to "Has anything changed?" exchange

### Phase 2: Document Authentication

**For JF5-DRAFT:**
- [ ] Verify email transmission date matches timeline
- [ ] Confirm this was version sent to respondents for review
- [ ] Check file metadata (creation date, modification date)
- [ ] Ensure no subsequent modifications to retrieved copy

**For JF5-FINAL:**
- [ ] Verify signatures are authentic
- [ ] Confirm signing date (11 August 2025)
- [ ] Obtain witness information if available
- [ ] Verify this is final executed version

### Phase 3: Witness Statements

**Daniel Faucitt's Statement Required:**

Critical testimony about:
1. **Review Process:**
   - "I reviewed the draft agreement dated [date]"
   - "I completed my review and had no concerns with the terms"
   - "The version I reviewed is attached as JF5-DRAFT"

2. **The Critical Exchange:**
   - "After completing my review, I was contacted by ENS"
   - "I was asked to 'check with Applicant' about something"
   - "I asked: 'Has anything changed since we reviewed it?'"
   - "I was told: 'No, we just added the details for the attorneys'"

3. **Understanding and Reliance:**
   - "I understood 'details for attorneys' to mean administrative information only"
   - "I did not request to see the revised version based on this assurance"
   - "I relied on this statement when signing the agreement"

4. **What Would Have Happened:**
   - "If I had known about the material changes documented in JF5-COMPARISON..."
   - "I would NOT have signed without reviewing the changes"
   - "I would have specifically objected to transfer of control to attorneys"
   - "I would have objected to the Gauteng Family Law Forum framework"
   - "I would have objected to the scope expansion to 'treatments'"

**Jacqueline Faucitt's Corroboration:**
- [ ] Confirm she reviewed same draft version
- [ ] Confirm same understanding of terms
- [ ] Confirm reliance on "details for attorneys" statement
- [ ] Confirm would not have signed if changes disclosed

### Phase 4: Comparative Analysis

**Complete the Comparison:**
- [ ] Extract text from both versions
- [ ] Identify all textual differences
- [ ] For each change, document:
  - Original language (JF5-DRAFT)
  - Changed language (JF5-FINAL)
  - Type of change (control, scope, framework, etc.)
  - Material vs. non-material classification
  - Legal significance

**Statistical Analysis:**
- [ ] Count total provisions in agreement
- [ ] Count number of changed provisions
- [ ] Count material changes vs. administrative changes
- [ ] Calculate percentage changed
- [ ] Prepare summary showing ratio of material to non-material changes

**Key Changes to Document:**

1. **Control Transfer Changes:**
   - Every instance where "parties" changed to "parties' attorneys"
   - Effect: Transfer of decision-making from parties to attorneys
   - Classification: MATERIAL

2. **Framework Addition:**
   - Addition of "Gauteng Family Law Forum" language
   - Effect: Creates jurisdictional concerns for UK citizens
   - Classification: MATERIAL

3. **Scope Expansion:**
   - Change from "evaluation" to "treatments"
   - Effect: Limited obligation becomes open-ended
   - Classification: MATERIAL

4. **Administrative Changes (if any):**
   - Attorney contact information
   - Law firm addresses
   - Service of notice provisions
   - Classification: Non-material (but likely minimal or nonexistent)

## Legal Significance

### Fraud in the Inducement Elements

This evidence establishes all required elements:

**1. Material Misrepresentation**
✓ Statement "No, just details for attorneys" was objectively false
✓ Proven by comparison showing material substantive changes

**2. Knowledge/Scienter**
✓ Attorney must have known changes were material
✓ Obvious from nature of changes (control transfer, scope expansion)

**3. Intent to Deceive**
✓ Purpose was to obtain signatures without disclosure
✓ False statement designed to prevent re-review

**4. Reliance**
✓ Respondents relied on false statement
✓ Did not request to see revised version based on assurance
✓ Signed without knowledge of material changes

**5. Damages**
✓ Bound to terms never agreed to
✓ Subject to attorney control not consented to
✓ Subject to institutional framework not accepted
✓ Subject to open-ended obligations not approved

### Relief Available

Based on this evidence:

1. **Declaration:** Settlement agreement (JF5-FINAL) is void ab initio
2. **Setting Aside:** All obligations under agreement are unenforceable
3. **Costs:** Peter should bear costs of remedying fraud by his attorneys
