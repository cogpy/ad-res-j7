# ANNEXURE JF5-FINAL: SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT - SIGNED VERSION WITH CHANGES

**Case Reference:** 2025-137857  
**Annexure Reference:** JF5-FINAL  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Date:** 11 August 2025 (Signed)  
**Purpose:** Final signed version of settlement agreement containing material changes made after respondents' review, demonstrating undisclosed modifications that constitute fraud in the inducement

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This annexure contains the **final signed version** of the settlement agreement that Jacqueline and Daniel Faucitt signed on 11 August 2025, two days before Peter Faucitt filed the ex parte interdict application. This version contains **material substantive changes** that were made after the respondents completed their review of the initial draft (JF5-DRAFT), but which were misrepresented to them as merely "details for attorneys."

### Key Evidence Elements:

1. **Modified Control Language** ("parties' attorneys" instead of "parties")
2. **Addition of "Gauteng Family Law Forum" Framework** (not in reviewed version)
3. **Expanded Scope Language** ("treatments" plural instead of single evaluation)
4. **Evidence of Copy-Paste Editing** (duplicate cost clauses)
5. **Signatures Procured Through Misrepresentation** (signed without knowledge of changes)

### Critical Importance:

This document establishes **what was actually signed** versus **what was reviewed**, proving:
- Material changes were made without disclosure after respondents' final review
- The attorney's statement "No, just details for attorneys" was false
- Control was transferred from parties to attorneys without respondents' knowledge
- New obligations and jurisdictional concerns were created without consent

## KEY PROVISIONS - FINAL SIGNED VERSION (WITH UNDISCLOSED CHANGES)

### Section 1: Background and Purpose

**[PLACEHOLDER: Insert exact background clauses from signed agreement]**

**Signed Version Contains:**
- Purpose stated as psychiatric evaluation and drug screening
- Timeline: To be completed by mid-October 2025
- **BUT:** Actual provisions create open-ended treatment obligations (see Section 2 below)

### Section 2: Evaluation Process (CHANGED VERSION - UNDISCLOSED)

**CRITICAL PROVISION - FINAL VERSION WITH CHANGES:**

**[PLACEHOLDER: Insert exact language showing "parties' attorneys" (changed from "parties") control selection]**

**Example of CHANGED Language:**
> "The **parties' attorneys** shall jointly select a qualified psychiatrist..."
> "The **parties' attorneys** shall jointly select a qualified medical professional for drug screening..."
> "The **parties' attorneys** shall agree on the location and timing..."

**Key Changes from Original (JF5-DRAFT):**

1. **Control Transferred to Attorneys:**
   - Original: **"Parties"** make selections
   - Changed to: **"Parties' attorneys"** make selections
   - Impact: Parties lose control over their own medical matters

2. **Attorney Unilateral Control:**
   - Attorneys select professionals (not parties themselves)
   - Attorneys agree on process (parties merely comply)
   - Attorneys control all material decisions

3. **Fundamental Shift in Agreement Nature:**
   - From: Voluntary agreement between family members
   - To: Lawyer-controlled medical intervention framework

**This Was NOT "Details for Attorneys" - This Was Transfer of Control**

### Section 3: Gauteng Family Law Forum (ADDED WITHOUT DISCLOSURE)

**[PLACEHOLDER: Insert exact Gauteng Family Law Forum provisions]**

**ADDED PROVISION (NOT in reviewed version):**

**Example of ADDED Language:**
> "The psychiatric evaluation shall be conducted through the **Gauteng Family Law Forum** framework..."
> "Professionals must be selected from the **Gauteng Family Law Forum** panel..."

**Critical Analysis of Addition:**

**What This Creates:**
1. **Jurisdictional Issues:**
   - Gauteng (South African) framework
   - Respondents are UK citizens with limited SA capacity
   - Creates compliance concerns for UK-based respondents

2. **Limits Professional Selection:**
   - Must use specific institutional framework
   - Cannot select independent professionals
   - Restricts choice to specific panel

3. **Institutional Control:**
   - Third-party framework involvement
   - Not the "private voluntary agreement" respondents thought they were signing
   - Creates formal legal/institutional process

**This Was NOT Disclosed During "Has Anything Changed?" Exchange**

### Section 4: Scope and Treatments (EXPANDED WITHOUT DISCLOSURE)

**[PLACEHOLDER: Insert scope provisions from signed version]**

**EXPANDED Scope in Signed Version:**

**Changed Language:**
- Original concept: "Psychiatric **evaluation**" (singular, one-time)
- Final version: "**Treatments**" (plural, ongoing)
- Impact: Once-off evaluation becomes open-ended obligation

**Specific Changes:**

1. **From Limited to Open-Ended:**
   - Original: One-time psychiatric evaluation
   - Final: Ongoing "treatments" with no defined end
   - Impact: Unlimited temporal obligation

2. **From Evaluation to Treatment:**
   - Original: Assessment and report (passive, informational)
   - Final: Active treatment interventions (ongoing, compelled)
   - Impact: From voluntary evaluation to compelled treatment program

3. **Financial Implications:**
   - Original: Cost of one evaluation
   - Final: Unlimited treatment costs over undefined period
   - Impact: Open-ended financial obligation

**Evidence of Copy-Paste Editing:**

**[PLACEHOLDER: Insert duplicate cost clauses showing hasty copy-paste editing]**

**Duplicate Clauses Found:**
- Cost allocation provision appears twice with identical/similar language
- Evidence of hasty editing and insertion of provisions
- Demonstrates changes were made quickly (supporting timeline of last-minute modifications)

### Section 5: Professional Selection (CHANGED VERSION)

**[PLACEHOLDER: Insert changed professional selection language]**

**Changed Selection Process:**

**Psychiatrist Selection:**
> "The **parties' attorneys** shall jointly select a qualified psychiatrist registered with [professional body] through the **Gauteng Family Law Forum** framework..."

**Drug Screening Professional:**
> "The **parties' attorneys** shall jointly select a qualified medical professional or accredited laboratory for drug screening..."

**Comparison with Original:**

| Element | Original (JF5-DRAFT) | Final (JF5-FINAL) | Material Change? |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Who Selects** | **Parties** | **Parties' attorneys** | ✓ YES - Control shifted |
| **Selection Framework** | Direct bilateral | **Gauteng Family Law Forum** | ✓ YES - Institutional framework imposed |
| **Party Autonomy** | **Parties control** | **Attorneys control** | ✓ YES - Fundamental rights transfer |
| **Jurisdiction** | Not specified | **Gauteng** (SA framework) | ✓ YES - Creates compliance issues |

**ALL These Changes Were Misrepresented as "Details for Attorneys"**

### Circumstances of Signing

**Timeline:**
1. **8-10 August 2025:** Respondents reviewed JF5-DRAFT (original version)
2. **10 August 2025:** Respondents completed review, approved terms
3. **10-11 August 2025:** ENS made changes WITHOUT notifying respondents
4. **11 August 2025 morning:** Respondents asked "Has anything changed?"
5. **11 August 2025:** Told "No, just details for attorneys" - FALSE
6. **11 August 2025:** Respondents signed based on false assurance
7. **13 August 2025:** Peter filed interdict (2 days after settlement signed)

### Reliance on Misrepresentation

**What Respondents Relied On:**
- Assurance that "nothing changed" since their review
- Representation that only "details for attorneys" were added
- Understanding these were administrative additions only

**What Respondents Did NOT Know:**
- Control had been transferred from parties to attorneys
- Gauteng Family Law Forum framework had been added
- Scope had been expanded from evaluation to treatments
- Material terms had been fundamentally altered

**Result: Signatures Procured by Fraud in the Inducement**

## STRATEGIC TIMING ANALYSIS

### Timeline: Settlement to Interdict

**11 August 2025:** Settlement agreement signed (this document)  
**13 August 2025:** Interdict filed (2 days later)

### Implications of Timing

1. **Coordinated Legal Strategy:**
   - Settlement signed with manipulated terms
   - Interdict filed immediately after
   - Suggests settlement was part of broader control strategy

2. **Use of Settlement as Leverage:**
   - Medical evaluation framework created
   - Could be used to pathologize respondents
   - Creates narrative for ongoing control and supervision

3. **Strategic Litigation Pattern:**
   - Sign settlement to create appearance of cooperation
   - Immediately file interdict to establish control
   - Use settlement terms as baseline for further demands

### Comparison with Investment Payout Timeline

**11 August 2025:** Settlement signed  
**May 2026:** Major investment payout due (9 months later)

**Inference:** Settlement and interdict filed **9 months before significant financial event**, suggesting financial motivation for control.

## EVIDENCE OF MANIPULATION

### 1. Material Changes After Review

**Documented Changes:**

| Provision | Original (Reviewed) | Final (Signed) | Disclosed? |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|------------|
| **Selection Authority** | "Parties" | "Parties' attorneys" | ❌ NO |
| **Framework** | None | "Gauteng Family Law Forum" | ❌ NO |
| **Scope** | Evaluation (singular) | Treatments (plural) | ❌ NO |
| **Control Structure** | Party autonomy | Attorney control | ❌ NO |

**ALL material changes made WITHOUT disclosure despite direct question**

### 2. False Statement About Changes

**The Question:** "Has anything changed?"

**The Response:** "No, we just added the details for attorneys."

**The Reality:**
- ❌ NOT "details for attorneys" (administrative)
- ✓ ACTUAL substantive changes to rights, obligations, and control
- ✓ MATERIAL alterations affecting fundamental agreement structure
- ✓ INTENTIONAL misrepresentation to obtain signatures

### 3. Pattern of Copy-Paste Editing

**[PLACEHOLDER: Document duplicate clauses and formatting errors]**

**Evidence of Hasty Editing:**
- Duplicate cost allocation clauses
- Inconsistent formatting
- Evidence of rapid copy-paste insertion
- Supports timeline of last-minute undisclosed changes

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH JF5-DRAFT

### For Detailed Comparison See: JF5-COMPARISON

**Summary of Material Changes:**

1. **Control Transfer:** Parties → Parties' attorneys (throughout)
2. **Framework Addition:** Gauteng Family Law Forum (not disclosed)
3. **Scope Expansion:** Evaluation → Treatments (plural, ongoing)
4. **Jurisdictional Issues:** SA framework imposed on UK citizens
5. **Cost Implications:** Limited → Unlimited financial exposure

**Legal Significance:**
- Each change is independently material
- Collectively, these changes fundamentally alter agreement nature
- No reasonable person would characterize these as "details for attorneys"
- Establishes knowing and intentional misrepresentation

## LEGAL CONSEQUENCES

### Fraud in the Inducement Elements

**1. Material Misrepresentation:**
✓ "Just details for attorneys" was objectively false  
✓ Actual changes were substantive and material

**2. Knowledge/Scienter:**

✓ Attorney knew statement would induce reliance without re-review

**3. Intent:**
✓ Purpose was to obtain signatures without disclosure  
✓ Deliberate concealment of material changes

**4. Reliance:**
✓ Respondents relied on false statement  
✓ Would not have signed if told truth about changes

✓ Lost autonomy over personal medical decisions

### Remedy Sought

**Relief Requested:**
1. **Declaration:** JF5-FINAL is void ab initio due to fraud in the inducement

**CRITICAL NOTE:** This annexure contains the settlement agreement as actually signed, showing the material changes that were concealed from the respondents through the false statement "No, just details for attorneys." The differences between this document and JF5-DRAFT establish that signatures were procured by fraud in the inducement. This agreement should be declared void ab initio, and all obligations under it should be set aside.
