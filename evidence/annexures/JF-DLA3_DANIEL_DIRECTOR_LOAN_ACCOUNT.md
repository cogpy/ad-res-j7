## TIMING AND CONTEXT ANALYSIS

### Timeline of Events:

**[PLACEHOLDER: Insert detailed timeline]**

- **[Historical Dates]:** Peter makes multiple withdrawals using identical process
- **[Years of Practice]:** All directors use same informal withdrawal process
- **[Settlement Context]:** Settlement negotiations intensify
- **16 July 2025:** Daniel makes R500,000 withdrawal (same process as always)
- **[Attorney Meeting Date]:** Peter consults attorney about settlement
- **[Days Later]:** Peter files ex parte application suddenly objecting to "identical" process he used for years

### Pattern Analysis:

**Suspicious Elements:**
1. **Sudden Change:** Peter never objected to identical process for **years**
2. **Selective Application:** Peter only objects when **others** use the process
3. **Timing Correlation:** Objection coincides with **settlement pressure**
4. **Hypocrisy:** Peter used **identical process** repeatedly without complaint

**Evidence of Pretext:**
- **No procedural change** occurred on 16 July 2025
- **No new circumstances** justified different treatment
- **No notification** to other directors of process change
- **Strategic timing** suggests ulterior motive rather than genuine procedural concern

## STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE

### 2. Exposes Peter's Contradictory Position

**Demonstrates:**

- Peter is **weaponizing normal business practices** for strategic advantage

### 3. Establishes Pretext

**Timeline Evidence:**
- **Years of acceptance** followed by **sudden objection**
- **Correlation with settlement negotiations** suggests strategic timing
- **No substantive change** in procedures or circumstances
- **Selective enforcement** indicates ulterior motive

### 4. Demonstrates Business Legitimacy

**Financial Evidence:**
- **Credit balance** proves company owes directors money (not unauthorized extraction)
- **Business contributions** justify account credits
- **Professional management** through proper accounting systems
- **Tax compliance** demonstrates legitimacy
