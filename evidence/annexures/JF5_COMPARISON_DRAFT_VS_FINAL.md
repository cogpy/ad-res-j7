## Draft Version vs. Final Signed Version

---

## Document Information

**Case No:** 2025-137857  
**Court:** High Court of South Africa, Gauteng Division, Pretoria  
**Annexure Reference:** JF5-COMPARISON  
**Purpose:** Comparison document highlighting all changes between JF5 draft and final versions  
**Date Prepared:** October 16, 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This document compares the **draft version** of the JF5 settlement agreement (as reviewed by the Respondents on or about 11 August 2025) with the **final signed version** (signed on or about 11 August 2025) to identify material changes made after the Respondents' final review.

### Key Finding

**Material changes were made to the JF5 agreement after the Respondents' final review and immediately before signing, without proper disclosure to the Respondents.**

When specifically asked **"Has anything changed?"**, the attorneys responded: **"No, we just added the details for the attorneys."**

This representation was **false**. Fundamental changes to control, scope, and oversight mechanisms had been made.

## Comparison of Material Terms

### 1. CONTROL OVER PROFESSIONAL SELECTION

#### Draft Version (As Reviewed)
**Language:** "parties" (referring to Peter Faucitt, Jacqueline Faucitt, and Daniel Faucitt)

**Effect:** 
- The three parties themselves would jointly select the professionals
- Direct party involvement and control
- Party-to-party agreement

#### Final Version (As Signed)
**Language:** "parties' attorneys" (replacing every instance of "parties")

**Effect:**
- Attorneys now control professional selection
- Parties excluded from selection process
- Transfers control from parties to their legal representatives

#### Materiality
This represents a **fundamental change** in the nature of the agreement:
- Changes from voluntary party-controlled process to attorney-controlled process
- Removes party autonomy and direct participation
- Alters the entire character of the agreement from private family arrangement to attorney-managed procedure

---

### 2. FAILSAFE APPOINTMENT MECHANISM

#### Draft Version (As Reviewed)
**Provision:** Reference to **"Gauteng Family Law Forum"** as neutral arbiter

**Effect:**
- If parties could not agree on professional selection, the Gauteng Family Law Forum would appoint
- Neutral third-party oversight mechanism
- Safeguard against unilateral control by any party

#### Final Version (As Signed)
**Provision:** **"Gauteng Family Law Forum" reference removed entirely**

**Effect:**
- No neutral third-party failsafe mechanism
- Attorneys have unilateral control with no neutral oversight
- No mechanism to resolve disagreements on professional selection

#### Materiality
This removal is **critically material** because:
- Eliminates the only safeguard against attorney abuse of discretion
- Creates potential for selection of professionals predisposed to find "issues"
- Removes the negotiated neutral oversight that Respondents specifically relied upon

---

### 3. SCOPE OF SERVICES

#### Draft Version (As Reviewed)
**Understanding:** Once-off evaluation event consisting of:
- Psychiatric evaluation by mid-October 2025
- Drug screening (hair-follicle test) by early October 2025
- Reports furnished to parties
- Clear, limited scope and timeframe

**Terms Discussed:**
- Single psychiatric assessment
- Single drug test
- Completion by mid-October 2025
- No mention of ongoing obligations

#### Final Version (As Signed)
**Actual Terms:** Open-ended "treatments" and additional services

**Language Added:**
- Provisions for ongoing "treatments" of unspecified nature
- Additional services to be provisioned without term limits
- Professionals granted authority to mandate further procedures
- No clear limitations on scope, duration, or cost

**Undisclosed Expansion:**
- From once-off evaluation → ongoing treatment obligations
- From defined timeframe → unlimited duration
- From agreed procedures → open-ended professional discretion
- From clear cost → unlimited financial exposure

#### Materiality
This scope expansion is **fundamentally material** because:
- Creates obligations never discussed or agreed to
- Transforms limited assessment into open-ended treatment regime
- Exposes Respondents to unlimited cost and duration
- Was never mentioned during negotiations
- Would have been refused if disclosed

---

### 4. JURISDICTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

#### Draft Version Understanding
**Respondents' Position:**
- Agreement structured as **private, voluntary arrangement** between parties
- Necessary because Respondents are UK citizens and tax residents
- Respondents have limited legal capacity in South Africa
- Respondents cannot participate in South African civil procedures in general
- Private agreement accommodates these jurisdictional limitations

**Draft Terms Consistent With:**
- Party control (parties can participate privately)
- Voluntary nature (not court-ordered)
- Family arrangement (between family members)

#### Final Version Impact
**Changes Undermine Jurisdictional Accommodation:**
- Transfer to attorney control defeats purpose of private agreement
- Attorney selection requires capacity Respondents do not have in SA
- Forces participation in attorney-managed process contrary to jurisdictional limitations
- Transforms private family arrangement into legal procedure

#### Materiality
The jurisdictional impact is **critically material** because:
- Respondents specifically structured agreement to accommodate UK residency limitations
- Attorney control requires legal capacity Respondents do not possess in South Africa
- Changes defeat the entire purpose of having a separate private agreement
- Respondents would have refused terms requiring SA civil procedure participation

## Detailed Change Analysis

### Change Category 1: Textual Substitutions

| Location | Draft Language | Final Language | Impact |
|----------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Professional Selection Clause | "the parties shall jointly select" | "the parties' attorneys shall jointly select" | Transfers selection authority from parties to attorneys |
| Report Distribution | "reports shall be furnished to the parties" | "reports shall be furnished to the parties' attorneys" | Attorneys control access to reports |
| Cost Allocation | "each party shall bear their own costs" | "each party shall bear their own costs" | **UNCHANGED** - creates inconsistency: why control transferred but cost burden remains with parties? |
| Agreement Disputes | "parties failing to agree" | "parties' attorneys failing to agree" | Disputes resolved between attorneys, not parties |

### Change Category 2: Structural Deletions

| Provision | Draft | Final | Impact |
|-----------|-------|-------|--------|
| Neutral Arbiter | Gauteng Family Law Forum appointed if parties disagree | Reference removed entirely | No neutral oversight or failsafe mechanism |
| Party Participation | Parties select professionals | Attorneys select, parties excluded | Removes party autonomy |

### Change Category 3: Scope Expansions

| Aspect | Draft Understanding | Final Language | Impact |
|--------|-------------------|---------------|---------|
| Nature of Services | Once-off evaluation | Open-ended "treatments" | Unlimited ongoing obligations |
| Timeframe | Completion by mid-October 2025 | No clear end date | Indefinite duration |
| Professional Authority | Conduct assessment, provide report | Mandate additional procedures at discretion | Unlimited professional control |
| Cost Exposure | Fixed cost for two assessments | Unlimited cost for additional services | Uncapped financial liability |

## Evidence of Misrepresentation

### The Critical Exchange

**Question by Daniel Faucitt:** "Has anything changed?"

**Answer by ENS Attorneys:** "No, we just added the details for the attorneys."

### Analysis of the Representation

#### What the Representation Implied:
- No substantive changes to terms
- Only administrative additions (contact details, etc.)
- Safe to sign without further review
- Agreement remains as reviewed

#### What Actually Happened:
- Fundamental changes to control mechanisms
- Removal of negotiated safeguards
- Expansion of scope and obligations
- Transfer of authority from parties to attorneys

### Legal Character of the Misrepresentation

**Elements of Fraud in the Inducement:**

1. **Material Misrepresentation:** False statement that nothing changed
2. **Scienter (Knowledge):** Attorneys knew substantial changes had been made
3. **Intent to Induce:** Statement made to obtain signatures without further review
4. **Justifiable Reliance:** Respondents reasonably relied on attorneys' representation
5. **Damages:** Respondents bound to terms they never agreed to

---

## Why Respondents Would Have Refused

### If Properly Disclosed:

#### 1. Attorney Control Issue
**Respondents Would Have:**
- Refused to transfer control from parties to attorneys
- Insisted on maintaining party control over professional selection
- Objected that attorney control defeats purpose of private agreement

**Reasons:**
- UK citizens with limited SA legal capacity
- Cannot participate in attorney-managed SA civil procedures
- Specifically negotiated private party agreement to avoid this
- Transfer of control fundamentally contrary to agreed structure

#### 2. Removal of Neutral Oversight
**Respondents Would Have:**
- Refused to proceed without Gauteng Family Law Forum failsafe
- Insisted on neutral third-party oversight mechanism
- Demanded protection against attorney abuse of discretion

**Reasons:**
- History of Applicant using professional opinions as weapons
- Risk of selection of professionals predisposed to find "issues"
- Need for impartial arbiter to ensure fairness

#### 3. Scope Expansion
**Respondents Would Have:**
- Refused open-ended treatment obligations
- Demanded clear limitations on scope, duration, and cost
- Insisted on once-off evaluation only as discussed

**Reasons:**
- Never agreed to ongoing treatments
- Cannot commit to unlimited financial exposure
- Scope expansion never discussed or negotiated
- Risk of weaponization through mandatory "treatments"

#### 4. Jurisdictional Concerns
**Respondents Would Have:**
- Sought independent legal advice on SA capacity implications
- Obtained UK legal opinion on enforceability
- Clarified how attorney control affects jurisdictional limitations

**Reasons:**
- UK tax residents with limited SA capacity
- Changes may exceed their legal capacity in South Africa
- Need to understand enforceability and obligations

## Connection to Broader Pattern of Manipulation

### Strategic Context

#### Timeline Pattern:
1. **11 August 2025:** Settlement agreement signed (with undisclosed changes)
2. **13 August 2025:** Interdict filed (only **2 days** after settlement)

#### Pattern Elements:
- Settlement obtained through misrepresentation
- Interdict filed immediately after
- Settlement used as negotiating leverage
- Medical testing weaponized as control mechanism

### Consistent with Applicant's Behavior Pattern

This manipulation is consistent with:
1. **Ex parte interdict** (obtained without proper disclosure)
2. **"Has anything changed?" exchange** (Peter's knowledge that nothing changed, yet filed interdict claiming new discoveries)
3. **Weaponization of professional opinions** (history of using professionals to enforce compliance)
4. **Strategic litigation timing** (interdict as negotiating tool, not legitimate response)

---

## Legal Consequences

### Ground 1: Fraud in the Inducement

**Legal Basis:**
- Material misrepresentation by attorneys
- Respondents relied on false assurance
- Would not have signed if properly informed
- Induced to sign through deception

**Remedy:**
Agreement should be declared **void or voidable**

### Ground 2: Mistake (Justus Error)

**Legal Basis:**
- Respondents operated under material misapprehension
- Misapprehension induced by attorneys' false statement
- Mistake goes to essence of agreement (control and scope)
- Would not have contracted on these terms

**Remedy:**
Agreement should be set aside or reformed

### Ground 3: Non Est Factum

**Legal Basis:**
- Document signed materially differs from document reviewed
- Changes made after final review without disclosure
- Respondents' minds did not go to actual terms
- Fundamental divergence between understanding and reality

**Remedy:**
Agreement not binding on Respondents

### Proposed Remedies

#### Primary Remedy:
**Declaration that JF5 agreement is void** due to fraud in the inducement

#### Alternative Remedy:
**Reformation of JF5 agreement** to reflect terms actually agreed to:
- Party control over professional selection (not attorney control)
- Gauteng Family Law Forum as failsafe appointment mechanism
- Once-off evaluation only (no ongoing treatments)
- Clear scope, duration, and cost limitations

## Documentary Evidence Requirements

### To Establish the Comparison:

☐ **JF5-DRAFT:** Copy of draft agreement as initially reviewed (before "details for attorneys" changes)

☐ **JF5-FINAL:** Copy of final signed agreement showing the changes

☐ **JF-DAN-WITNESS:** Daniel Faucitt's witness statement confirming:
   - "Has anything changed?" question
   - "No, we just added the details for the attorneys" response
   - Timeline of review and signing
   - Reliance on attorneys' representation

☐ **UK-RESIDENCE:** UK tax residency documentation establishing:
   - Respondents' UK citizenship
   - UK tax resident status
   - Limited SA legal capacity
   - Jurisdictional limitations on SA civil procedure participation

☐ **TIMELINE-DOC:** Timeline documentation showing:
   - Settlement agreement date: 11 August 2025
   - Interdict filing date: 13 August 2025
   - Only 2 days between settlement and interdict

☐ **PATTERN-EVIDENCE:** Evidence of historical pattern of weaponizing professional opinions (if available)

## Conclusion

The comparison of the JF5 draft and final versions reveals **material, undisclosed changes** that fundamentally altered the nature, scope, and control mechanisms of the agreement.

These changes were **concealed through false assurances** when the Respondents specifically asked "Has anything changed?"

The changes are so fundamental that they go to the **essence of the agreement**, transforming it from:
- Party-controlled → Attorney-controlled
- Neutral oversight → No oversight
- Limited scope → Open-ended obligations
- Private arrangement → Legal procedure

The Respondents **would not have signed** if properly informed of these changes.

The agreement was obtained through **fraud in the inducement** and should be declared **void or voidable**.

At minimum, the agreement should be **reformed** to reflect the terms the Respondents actually reviewed and agreed to.
