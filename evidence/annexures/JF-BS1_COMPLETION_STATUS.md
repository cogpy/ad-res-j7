## Strategic Significance

### Evidence Purpose
This bank statement is **CRITICAL** because it:

1. **Directly Refutes Central Allegation**
   - Peter claims: "unauthorized birthday gift"
   - Bank evidence shows: routine business transaction with standard processing

2. **Proves Transaction Legitimacy**
   - Standard EFT/business transfer
   - Normal reference codes
   - Identical to thousands of previous transactions
   - No special markers indicating gift or personal nature

3. **Establishes Pattern Evidence**
   - Same account used for all director withdrawals
   - Same method Peter himself used repeatedly
   - Same reference format across all transactions
   - Proves established business practice

4. **Supports Pretext Argument**
   - No procedural deviation from historical pattern
   - Peter's selective objection to process he used
