## Overview

The RegimA businesses maintain director loan accounts for all directors. These accounts track funds advanced by directors to the companies for operational purposes, working capital, and business development over the history of the businesses.

**Key Principle:** Director loan accounts with **credit balances** (positive balances) indicate that **the companies owe money to the directors**, not the other way around.

## Summary

### Combined Director Loan Account Credit Balances

| Director | Total Credit Balance | Percentage |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| Peter Andrew Faucitt (Applicant) | R3,800,000 | 33.0% |
| Jacqueline Faucitt (First Respondent) | R4,200,000 | 36.5% |
| Daniel James Faucitt (Second Respondent) | R3,500,000 | 30.5% |
| **TOTAL** | **R11,500,000** | **100%** |

### Key Facts

1. **Substantial Credit Balances:** All three directors have substantial credit balances in their director loan accounts, demonstrating that **the companies owe the directors significant sums**, not the other way around.

2. **Historical Accumulation:** These balances have accumulated over:
   - **15 years** for RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (since 2010)
   - **18 years** for RegimA Skin Treatments CC (since 2007)
   - **12 years** for Strategic Logistics CC (since 2013)
   - **14 years** for Villa Via Arcadia No 2 CC (since 2011)

3. **Legitimate Payment Context:** The R500,000 payment to Jacqueline Faucitt on 16 July 2025 represents only **11.9%** of her total director loan account credit balance of R4.2 million. This payment was entirely legitimate as it was a partial withdrawal against funds she had previously advanced to the companies.

4. **Applicant's Position:** The Applicant himself has a director loan account credit balance of R3.8 million, demonstrating his own extensive use of the same director loan account system he now challenges.

## Established Practice

### Historical Practice (15+ years)

For the entire history of the RegimA businesses, director-company transactions have been processed according to the following **established practice:**

1. **Bank Statement References:** Transactions are clearly marked on bank statements with appropriate references (e.g., "Director Loan - Jax", "DL - Peter")

2. **Automatic Allocation:** Bank feeds automatically allocate transfers to corresponding director loan accounts based on transaction references

3. **Regular Reconciliation:** Reconciliation occurs during regular accounting processes (monthly and quarterly)

4. **No Formal Board Resolutions:** Formal board resolutions are NOT required for routine director loan account transactions, consistent with the informal, family-business operating model

5. **All Directors Participate:** All three directors (Peter, Jacqueline, and Daniel) have accepted and utilized this practice throughout the history of the businesses

## Legal Context

### Close Corporations Act

Under the Close Corporations Act 69 of 1984:
- Members of a close corporation may make drawings against their member's interest
- Member loan accounts are a standard mechanism for tracking funds advanced by members
- No formal board resolutions are required for routine member loan transactions in the absence of specific provisions in the founding documents

### Companies Act

For the company (RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd):
- Director loan accounts are recognized accounting mechanisms
- Directors may advance funds to companies for operational purposes
- Repayment of director loans is not subject to the same restrictions as director remuneration
- The payment of R500,000 represents a partial repayment of funds previously advanced by the director

## Strategic Significance

### Undermines Applicant's Primary Allegation

The Applicant characterizes the R500,000 payment to Jacqueline as an unauthorized "birthday gift" and the basis for seeking an urgent interdict.

However:

1. **Legitimate Payment:** The payment was a partial withdrawal against Jacqueline's R4.2 million director loan account credit balance - entirely legitimate

2. **Applicant's Hypocrisy:** The Applicant himself has a R3.8 million credit balance and has made similar withdrawals throughout the history of the businesses

3. **Established Practice:** The payment followed the exact same practice that has operated successfully for 15+ years and that the Applicant himself has accepted and utilized

4. **Material Non-Disclosure:** The Applicant's failure to disclose the director loan account context in his ex parte application constitutes a material non-disclosure

### Timeline Demonstrates Pretext

- **16 July 2025:** R500,000 payment processed (routine director loan account transaction)
- **5 August 2025:** Applicant first consulted attorneys (20 days later)
- **13 August 2025:** Applicant filed ex parte interdict application (28 days later)

This timeline demonstrates that the R500,000 payment was used as a **pretext** for the interdict application, rather than representing genuine concern about unauthorized transactions.

---

## Conclusion

The director loan account balances demonstrate conclusively that:

1. **Companies Owe Directors Millions:** The combined credit balance of R11.5 million shows that the companies owe the directors large sums, accumulated over 15+ years

2. **R500K Payment Was Legitimate:** The R500,000 payment to Jacqueline represents only 11.9% of her credit balance and was entirely legitimate

3. **Applicant's Inconsistency:** The Applicant's own R3.8 million credit balance demonstrates his acceptance and utilization of the same system

4. **Material Non-Disclosure:** The Applicant's failure to disclose this context in his ex parte application is material and demonstrates bad faith
