## Established Practice - Historical Context

### Duration of Practice

This practice of using director loan accounts for director-company transactions has been in place for:
- **Minimum:** 15 years (since approximately 2010)
- **Maximum:** 25+ years (since founding of RegimA businesses)
- **Consistency:** Applied uniformly to all directors throughout this period

### Typical Director Loan Account Transactions

Director loan accounts at RegimA typically record the following transaction types:

1. **Deferred Salary/Remuneration**
   - Directors contribute services to the business
   - Remuneration is not immediately paid out in cash
   - Accumulates as credit balance in director loan account

2. **Company Expenses Paid Personally by Directors**
   - Directors pay business expenses from personal funds
   - Expenses are recorded as company costs
   - Director loan account is credited (company owes director)

3. **Working Capital Advances**
   - Directors provide cash to the company for working capital
   - Recorded as credit to director loan account

4. **Drawings/Withdrawals**
   - Directors withdraw funds from the company
   - Recorded as debit to director loan account
   - **No board resolution required** under established practice

5. **Dividend Distributions** (when formally declared)
   - May be paid directly or allocated to director loan accounts
   - Board resolution typically required for formal dividend declaration

### Board Resolution Requirements

**Historical Practice at RegimA:**
- **Formal board resolutions** are NOT required for routine director loan account transactions
- Board resolutions are typically used for:
  - Appointment/removal of directors
  - Material contracts and commitments
  - Formal dividend declarations
  - Significant capital expenditures
  - Banking facility approvals
  
- **Director drawings** from loan accounts are treated as:
  - Routine financial transactions
  - Withdrawals against existing credit balances (amounts already owed to director)
  - Similar to partners' drawings in a partnership
  - Documented via bank references and accounting records

**Legal Context:**
- RegimA businesses are close corporations and/or private companies
- Operated on a family/collaborative basis with informal governance
- Close Corporations Act and Companies Act allow members/directors to withdraw amounts owed to them without formal resolution
- Practice accepted by all directors for decades

## Conclusion

The accounting records for the R500,000 payment on 16 July 2025 demonstrate:
