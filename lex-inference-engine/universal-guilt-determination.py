"""
Universal Guilt Determination System
====================================

A sophisticated optimization method that uses a lex inference engine to enumerate 
and resolve every conceivable configuration of agent-arena-event horizons to solve 
for the general case where regardless of any actions taken by any agent, if all 
information is considered then the guilty party is always guilty.

This system implements:
- Themis (Divine Law) - The relational fabric over possibility space
- Nemesis (Divine Retribution) - The delta measurement between reality and justice
- Agent-Arena-Event Horizon enumeration
- Universal guilt determination through complete information analysis
