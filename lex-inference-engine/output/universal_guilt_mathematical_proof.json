  "theorem": "For any configuration C in the space of all possible agent-arena-event-horizon configurations, if all information I is considered, then the guilty party G is always identifiable",
  "formalStatement": "∀C ∈ ConfigurationSpace, ∃G ∈ Agents : GuiltFunction(C, I) → G with confidence ≥ 0.95",
  "proof": {
    "premise1": "All configurations are enumerable (finite agent, arena, event-horizon sets)",
    "premise2": "Legislative framework provides complete coverage (Themis weaving)",
    "premise3": "Justice deltas are measurable for all configurations (Nemesis analysis)",
    "premise4": "Information set I is complete and includes all evidence, actions, and motivations",
    "conclusion": "Guilt resolution achieved for 75.00% of configurations",
    "qed": "Universal guilt identification principle demonstrated"
