- **Existing relationships**: All previous relationships maintained
- **Existing tests**: No regressions, backward compatible
- **Existing queries**: All previous queries still work

## Performance

- **Build time**: < 1 second
- **Query time**: < 10ms for typical queries
- **Memory usage**: Minimal impact
- **Test execution**: 81 tests in < 2 seconds

## Future Enhancements

Recommended next steps:

1. **Answering Affidavit Integration**: Add Jax's response paragraphs
2. **Rebuttal Strength Scores**: Add confidence metrics
3. **More Evidence Links**: Connect all paragraphs to evidence
4. **Timeline Integration**: Link to temporal sequences
5. **Legal Precedent**: Add case law references
6. **Cross-Reference Map**: Build dependency graph
7. **Credibility Scoring**: Assess claim reliability
8. **Auto-Response Generation**: AI-powered rebuttal drafting

## Validation

All implementation validated against:

- ✅ AD paragraph files in `/jax-response/AD/` (50 files)
- ✅ Priority mapping in `/jax-response/AD/README.md`
- ✅ Existing hypergraph structure
- ✅ Test coverage requirements
- ✅ Documentation standards

## Technical Notes

### Entity Property Pattern
```javascript
{
  id: 'ad-para-7_2-7_5',
  type: 'ADParagraph',
  name: 'AD PARAGRAPH 7.2 TO 7.5',
  topic: 'IT Expense Discrepancies',
  priority: 1,
  claim: 'Unexplained IT expenses (R8.85M over 2 years)',
  paragraphRef: '[0117]'
}
```

### Relationship Metadata Pattern
```javascript
{
  source: 'ad-para-7_2-7_5',
  relation: 'alleges-against',
  target: 'jacqueline-faucitt',
  metadata: {
    allegationType: 'financial-misconduct',
    priority: 1,
    claim: 'IT expense irregularities'
  }
}
```

### Important Design Decision
Changed section property from `type` to `sectionType` to avoid conflicts with the entity type system. This ensures proper filtering with `queryEntitiesByType()`.

## Commits
