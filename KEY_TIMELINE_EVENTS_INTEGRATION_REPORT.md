const peterEvents = hg.queryBySource('peter-faucitt')
  .filter(r => r.relation === 'orchestrated');

/ Find critical timeline events
const criticalEvents = hg.queryEntitiesByType('Event')
  .filter(e => e.severity === 'Critical');

/ Find events with financial impact
const financialEvents = hg.queryEntitiesByType('Event')
  .filter(e => e.financialImpact || e.monthlyServiceCost);

/ Trace causal chains
const causalChain = hg.queryByRelation('caused')
  .map(r => ({from: r.source, to: r.target}));
```

## KEY INSIGHTS REVEALED

### 1. Strategic Coordination Pattern

The timeline integration reveals clear premeditation:
- Settlement signed 8 days before interdict
- Crisis manufactured through card cancellations
- Investment payout 9 months after control seizure

### 2. Financial Motive Exposed

Total quantifiable damage: **R9,075,000+**
- R5.2M asset stripping (February)
- R3.1M revenue loss (May-August)
- R775K service disruptions

### 3. Perjury Network Identified

Multiple parties committed perjury:
- Peter (email control claims)
- Bantjies (knew of crimes before affidavit)
- ENS Africa (suppressed criminal knowledge)

### 4. Evidence Destruction Timeline

Progressive evidence elimination:
- April 30: Physical server missing
- May 22: Audit trails destroyed
- June 8: Business records disrupted

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Timeline events fully integrated into hypergraph
2. ✅ Documentation complete in AD hierarchy
3. ✅ Evidence references mapped

### Post-Interdict Priorities
1. Extract email evidence for all timeline events
2. Obtain police reports for Kayla murder
3. Analyze estate documentation
4. Forensic accounting for R5.2M fraud
5. System log analysis for access patterns

### Legal Strategy Enhancement
1. Use timeline to demonstrate bad faith
2. Highlight 8-day settlement timing
3. Expose investment payout motive
4. Document perjury instances

## TECHNICAL VERIFICATION

```bash
# Test successful integration
npm run hypergraph:example

# Results:
✅ 21 total events (5 existing + 16 new)
✅ 93 total entities (up from 76)
✅ 65 total relationships (up from 50)
✅ All queries functional
```

## CONCLUSION

The key timeline events are now fully integrated into both the AD hypergraph and Financial hypergraph structures. Each event is:
- ✅ Properly linked to related entities
- ✅ Connected to financial impacts
- ✅ Referenced to evidence sources
- ✅ Cited in Response Affidavits
- ✅ Documented in AD folder hierarchy

This comprehensive integration provides a powerful tool for:
- Legal analysis and strategy
- Evidence organization
- Financial impact assessment
- Perjury documentation
- Strategic narrative development

The timeline clearly demonstrates Peter's bad faith, strategic coordination, and the manufactured nature of the crisis used to justify the interdict.
