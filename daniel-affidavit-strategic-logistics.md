## SUPPLEMENTARY AFFIDAVIT

I, the undersigned,

**DANIEL JAN FREDERIK FARRAR**

do hereby make oath and state as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 I am the Second Respondent in this matter and a director of the Third to Sixth Respondents.

1.2 I am also the sole owner of Strategic Logistics CC, a close corporation that has been systematically destroyed through criminal conduct orchestrated by Ms. Rynette Farrar.

1.3 The facts herein are within my personal knowledge unless otherwise stated and are both true and correct.

1.4 I fully support and confirm the contents of the First Respondent's supplementary affidavit, particularly regarding:
   - 1.4.1 The R100,000 monthly personal financial hemorrhage
   - 1.4.2 The criminal enterprise operated by Rynette Farrar
   - 1.4.3 The urgent need to set aside the interdict

### 2. THE SYSTEMATIC DESTRUCTION OF STRATEGIC LOGISTICS CC

**2.1 Background of Strategic Logistics**

2.1.1 Strategic Logistics CC (Registration: [NUMBER]) is a close corporation I founded to supply packaging materials, logistics services, and related products.

2.1.2 Before Rynette Farrar gained control of RegimA's financial operations, Strategic Logistics was:
   - A profitable supplier to the RegimA group
   - Operating with healthy margins of 30-40%
   - Growing steadily with monthly revenues of R[amount]
   - Employing [number] people

**2.2 The Criminal Destruction Pattern**

2.2.1 From approximately [date] when Rynette Farrar gained control, Strategic Logistics was subjected to systematic destruction through:

**2.2.2 Forced Below-Cost Sales**
- Strategic Logistics was forced to supply products at 10-20% BELOW cost
- While Adderory (her son's company) supplied identical products at 40-50% ABOVE market rates
- I was told to accept these terms or lose all RegimA business

**Example of Criminal Price Manipulation:**

| Product | Our Cost | Forced Selling Price | Loss | Adderory Price | Adderory Profit |
|---------|----------|---------------------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Packaging Box A | R10.00 | R8.00 | -R2.00 | R15.00 | +R5.00 |
| Label Set B | R25.00 | R20.00 | -R5.00 | R40.00 | +R15.00 |
| Shipping Material C | R100.00 | R85.00 | -R15.00 | R150.00 | +R50.00 |

2.2.3 I attach hereto marked **"DJF1"** comparative invoices showing:
   - Strategic Logistics forced to sell below cost
   - Adderory selling identical items at inflated prices
   - The systematic pattern of destruction

**2.3 The Stock Write-Off Fraud**

2.3.1 Between [dates], Strategic Logistics delivered stock worth approximately R[amount] to RegimA companies.

2.3.2 This stock was then "written off" through journal entries by Rynette Farrar, with reasons such as:
   - "Stock adjustment"
   - "Inventory correction"
   - "System reconciliation"
   - No actual explanation

2.3.3 The stock was delivered, received, and used - but never paid for due to these fraudulent write-offs.

2.3.4 I attach hereto marked **"DJF2"**:
   - Delivery notes signed by RegimA
   - Journal entries writing off the stock
   - Proof the stock was actually used in production

**2.4 The Redirection of Business**

2.4.1 From [date], all substantial orders were redirected to Adderory:
   - Previous monthly orders to Strategic Logistics: R[amount]
   - Current monthly orders: R[amount] (90% reduction)
   - Adderory's monthly billing: R[amount] (for identical products)

2.4.2 This was not business competition - this was criminal conduct by a bookkeeper destroying a supplier to enrich her son's company.

### 3. QUANTIFIED FINANCIAL DESTRUCTION

**3.1 Direct Losses from Below-Cost Sales**

| Period | Products Sold | Revenue | Actual Cost | Loss |
|--------|--------------|---------|-------------|------|
| 2022 | [Quantity] | R[amount] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| 2023 | [Quantity] | R[amount] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| 2024 | [Quantity] | R[amount] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| 2025 | [Quantity] | R[amount] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| **TOTAL** | | | | **R[amount]** |

**3.2 Stock Written Off Without Payment**

| Period | Stock Delivered | Value | Amount Written Off |
|--------|----------------|-------|-------------------|
| 2023 | [Description] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| 2024 | [Description] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| 2025 | [Description] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| **TOTAL** | | | **R[amount]** |

**3.3 Lost Business to Adderory**

| Year | Expected Revenue | Actual Revenue | Lost to Adderory |
|------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|
| 2022 | R[amount] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| 2023 | R[amount] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| 2024 | R[amount] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| 2025 | R[amount] | R[amount] | R[amount] |
| **TOTAL** | | | **R[amount]** |

**3.4 Total Destruction: R[TOTAL AMOUNT]**

3.4.1 I attach hereto marked **"DJF3"** Strategic Logistics' financial statements showing:
   - Profitable operations before Rynette's control
   - Systematic losses after her interference
   - Current technical insolvency

### 4. THE CRIMINAL PATTERN

**4.1 This Was Not Business - This Was Crime**

4.1.1 A legitimate business does not:
   - Force suppliers to sell below cost
   - Write off millions in delivered stock
   - Redirect all business to the bookkeeper's son
   - Destroy established suppliers to create monopolies

4.1.2 This pattern reveals:
   - Abuse of position (bookkeeper controlling supplier terms)
   - Self-dealing (benefiting her son's company)
   - Fraud (writing off delivered stock)
   - Anti-competitive conduct (destroying competition)

**4.2 The Modus Operandi**

4.2.1 Step 1: Force Strategic Logistics to sell below cost
4.2.2 Step 2: Don't pay for delivered stock (write it off)
4.2.3 Step 3: Redirect orders to Adderory at inflated prices
4.2.4 Step 4: Use RegimA's money to enrich Adderory
4.2.5 Result: Strategic Logistics destroyed, Adderory enriched

### 5. THE BROADER CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE CONTEXT

5.1 The destruction of Strategic Logistics was not isolated but part of the broader criminal scheme:

**5.1.1 The Setup (April 2021)**
- Three companies registered in 16 days
- Adderory positioned as "supplier"
- Rynette positioned as gatekeeper

**5.1.2 The Execution (2021-2025)**
- Competitors destroyed or marginalized
- Adderory given preferential treatment
- Millions diverted through various schemes

**5.1.3 The Cover-Up (2025)**
- Audit trails destroyed (Shopify)
- Bank accounts changed
- Customers redirected to Adderory's websites

### 6. THE IMPACT OF THE INTERDICT

6.1 The interdict prevents us from:
   - 6.1.1 Investigating the full extent of the fraud
   - 6.1.2 Recovering stolen funds
   - 6.1.3 Protecting Strategic Logistics from further harm
   - 6.1.4 Gathering evidence for criminal prosecution

6.2 Meanwhile, the criminal enterprise continues:
   - 6.2.1 Operating freely under court protection
   - 6.2.2 Destroying evidence daily
   - 6.2.3 Enriching themselves with stolen funds
   - 6.2.4 Causing us to hemorrhage R100,000/month personally

### 7. RELIEF SOUGHT

7.1 I support all relief sought in the First Respondent's affidavit.

7.2 Additionally, I specifically seek:

**7.2.1 Investigation of Strategic Logistics Destruction**
- Full forensic audit of all transactions
- Recovery of fraudulently written-off amounts
- Criminal charges for the systematic destruction

**7.2.2 Preservation of Evidence**
- All Rynette Farrar communications regarding Strategic Logistics
- All journal entries affecting Strategic Logistics
- All Adderory comparative transactions

**7.2.3 Damages**
- Direct losses from below-cost sales: R[amount]
- Written-off stock: R[amount]
- Lost business: R[amount]
- Consequential damages: To be determined

### 8. CONCLUSION

8.1 Strategic Logistics CC has been criminally destroyed to enrich Adderory (Pty) Ltd through the criminal conduct of Rynette Farrar.

8.2 This destruction is part of a broader criminal enterprise that has:
   - Hijacked the RegimA businesses
   - Caused us to hemorrhage R100,000/month personally
   - Operated with impunity under court protection

8.3 The interdict must be set aside immediately to:
   - Stop the financial hemorrhage
   - Investigate the criminal conduct
   - Preserve remaining evidence
   - Prevent further destruction

8.4 Every day of delay allows the criminals to profit while we pay personally for infrastructure they use to steal from us.

**WHEREFORE** I respectfully pray for the relief set out above.
