## Key Legal Arguments Established

### 1. Material Non-Disclosure = Fraud on Court
Peter deliberately concealed material facts about Jacqueline's regulatory role, misleading the court about the true consequences of the interdict. This constitutes grounds for setting aside the order.

### 2. Disproportionate Harm = Constitutional Violation  
**3,700:1 harm ratio** violates constitutional proportionality requirements. Risking €1.85 billion in regulatory penalties to investigate €500K in legitimate expenses fails any reasonableness test.

### 3. Bad Faith = Ulterior Motive Exposed
Peter's choice of the most harmful available remedy, despite less restrictive alternatives, demonstrates bad faith and ulterior motive inconsistent with his stated aims.

### 4. Company Endangerment = Breach of Fiduciary Duty
By creating regulatory non-compliance that threatens the companies' market access and reputation, Peter has breached his fiduciary duty to protect company interests.
