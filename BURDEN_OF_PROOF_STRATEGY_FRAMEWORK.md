# Burden of Proof Strategy Framework
## Case 2025-137857: Proving Guilt Across Legal Standards

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Context:** Secondary task in phase 2 structure implementation  
**Source:** Line 64, todo/workflow-validation-tests.md

---

## Executive Summary

This document establishes optimal strategies and necessary conditions for proving guilt of agents (Peter Faucitt, Rynette Farrar, Daniel Jacobus Bantjes, and others) across three distinct evidentiary standards. The framework addresses the burden of proof requirements for demonstrating disproportionate harm and other legal violations at each level:

1. **Civil Standard**: Balance of probabilities (≥51% likelihood)
2. **Criminal Standard**: Beyond reasonable doubt (≥85% certainty)
3. **Mathematical Standard**: Invariant conditions (100% logical certainty)

Each standard requires progressively stronger evidence, documentation, and proof methodologies. This framework provides the strategic roadmap for Dan and Jax to establish guilt at each level.

---

## I. Legal Standards Framework

### 1.1 Civil Standard: Balance of Probabilities

**Threshold:** 51% likelihood (more probable than not)  
**Burden:** Preponderance of evidence  
**Application:** Civil litigation, damages, interdict proceedings

**Standard Description:**
The civil standard requires proving that it is more likely than not that the alleged conduct occurred. This is the lowest burden of proof and relies on the weight of evidence rather than absolute certainty.

**Strategic Approach:**
- Document patterns of behavior
- Establish circumstantial evidence chains
- Demonstrate inconsistencies in opposing narratives
- Use expert testimony to support inferences

### 1.2 Criminal Standard: Beyond Reasonable Doubt

**Threshold:** 85%+ certainty (moral certainty, excluding reasonable doubt)  
**Burden:** Prosecution must eliminate reasonable doubt  
**Application:** Criminal prosecution, imprisonment, criminal sanctions

**Standard Description:**
The criminal standard requires proof to a moral certainty that excludes reasonable doubt. This is a high standard designed to protect individuals from wrongful conviction.

**Strategic Approach:**
- Require direct evidence where possible
- Eliminate alternative explanations
- Establish clear chain of causation
- Use multiple independent evidence sources
- Anticipate and rebut defense arguments

### 1.3 Mathematical Standard: Invariant Conditions

**Threshold:** 100% logical certainty (mathematical proof)  
**Burden:** Logical demonstration of necessary truth  
**Application:** Fraud detection, system analysis, logical proofs

**Standard Description:**
The mathematical standard requires logical proof that certain conditions must be true given the established facts. This creates invariant conditions that cannot be disputed without contradicting established evidence.

**Strategic Approach:**
- Use transactional records with timestamps
- Establish logical impossibilities
- Create mathematical proofs of inconsistency
- Use system logs as immutable evidence
- Demonstrate logical contradictions in opposing claims
