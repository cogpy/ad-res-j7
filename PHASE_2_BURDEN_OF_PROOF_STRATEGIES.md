## Executive Summary

This document implements **optimal strategies and burden of proof frameworks** for Daniel James Faucitt (Dan) and Jacqueline Faucitt (Jax) to prove guilt of other agents across three legal standards:

1. **Civil Standard:** Balance of probabilities (51%+ likelihood)
2. **Criminal Standard:** Beyond reasonable doubt (95%+ certainty)

## Integration with Legal Attention Engine

### Attention Mechanism Enhancement

This burden of proof framework integrates with the existing `legal_attention_engine.py` by:

1. **Enhanced Attention Heads:**
   - **Burden-of-Proof Head:** Attends to evidence meeting specific standards
   - **Standard-Switching Head:** Adapts attention based on legal context
   - **Evidence-Strength Head:** Weights evidence by proof standard requirements

2. **Positional Encodings:**
   - **Proof-Standard Position:** Civil/Criminal/Mathematical context
   - **Evidence-Strength Position:** Necessity/Sufficiency weighting
   - **Agent-Specific Position:** Target agent for guilt determination

3. **Cross-Attention Mechanisms:**
   - **Evidence-Standard Attention:** Links evidence to appropriate standard
   - **Agent-Strategy Attention:** Connects agents to optimal proof strategies
   - **Defense-Counter Attention:** Anticipates and counters defenses

### Code Integration Example:
```python
from burden_of_proof_strategies import BurdenOfProofStrategies
from legal_attention_engine import LegalAttentionEngine

# Initialize systems
proof_strategies = BurdenOfProofStrategies()
attention_engine = LegalAttentionEngine()

# Generate evidence plan for specific agent/standard
evidence_plan = proof_strategies.generate_evidence_collection_plan(
    agent_key="peter", 
    standard=LegalStandard.CIVIL
)

# Use attention engine for guilt determination
guilt_analysis = attention_engine.analyze_guilt_pattern(
    evidence=evidence_plan,
    agents=["peter", "rynette", "bantjies"],
    standard="civil"
)
```
