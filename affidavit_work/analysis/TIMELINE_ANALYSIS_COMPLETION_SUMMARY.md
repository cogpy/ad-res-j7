## Key Findings Summary

### 1. Two-Month Delay (June → August 2025)

**Evidence:** 
- IT expense questions: June-July 2025
- Reports to Bantjies: Mid-June 2025
- Interdict filed: August 14, 2025

**Argument:** "If genuinely urgent, why wait 2 months?"

---

### 2. Eight-Day Gap (Settlement → Interdict)

**Finding:** Settlement agreement signed ~August 6, interdict filed August 14

**Significance:** Strategic litigation for settlement leverage

**Evidence:**
- Settlement agreement date: TBD (approximately August 6)
- Interdict filing: August 14, 2025
- Gap: 8 days

**Argument:** "Interdict is negotiating tool, not business protection"

**Significance:** Peter manufactured the documentation crisis

**Evidence:**

**Argument:** "Peter created the problem he now complains about"

**Significance:** Financial motive for seizing control

**Evidence:**
- Interdict granted: August 19, 2025
- Investment payout: ~May 2026 (TBD - needs confirmation)
