## Key Arguments by Section

### When Addressing Urgency Claims

> "The Applicant claims urgent concern requiring immediate Court intervention, yet waited **over 2 months** (June to August 2025) before filing this application. This delay is fundamentally inconsistent with genuine urgency and demonstrates strategic planning, not emergency response."

### When Addressing Documentation Complaints

> "The timeline proves the Applicant manufactured this crisis. Daniel provided all reports to accountant Bantjies in mid-June 2025. **The very next day**, the Applicant cancelled all business cards without notice. This created the documentation access problems the Applicant now complains about. The Applicant then demanded documentation, knowing his own actions made comprehensive response impossible."

### When Addressing Settlement Timing

> "The interdict was filed just **8 days** after the settlement agreement was signed. This strategic timing demonstrates the interdict serves as a negotiating tool for settlement discussions, not genuine business protection. This is strategic litigation, not a legitimate response to alleged misconduct."

### When Addressing Information Manipulation

> "The Sage screenshots dated June 20 and August 25, 2025 prove Rynette Farrar controlled Pete@regima.com throughout this period. The Applicant claims in his affidavit to have received emails and information directly. However, the Applicant does not use a computer. All information came through intermediaries, particularly Rynette who controlled the email account. The Applicant's sworn statements about direct email receipt constitute perjury."

### When Addressing Bantjies Perjury

> "Mr. Bantjies learned of criminal matters on **June 10, 2025** (murder, fraud, theft). **65 days later**, on August 14, 2025, he provided a confirmatory affidavit in support of the Applicant's interdict. He failed to disclose the criminal matters to the Court. Knowledge of material facts + false affidavit = perjury under oath. Moreover, as trustee, his affidavit against beneficiary Daniel constitutes breach of fiduciary duty."

### When Addressing Financial Motive

> "The investment payout is due approximately **9 months** after the interdict was granted. The interdict gives the Applicant control of business operations during this critical period. The timing correlation demonstrates the interdict serves a financial positioning purpose, not business protection."

## Courtroom Presentation Tips

### Opening Statement
1. Start with timeline overview
2. Highlight the three critical gaps: 2 months, 8 days, 9 months
3. Introduce "self-created crisis" concept
4. Frame as strategic litigation, not emergency response

### When Questioned About Delays
- **Always return to:** "2-month delay contradicts urgency"
- **Emphasize:** Peter had time to plan, not emergency situation
- **Contrast:** Genuine emergency vs. strategic planning

### When Questioned About Documentation
- **Lead with:** "Reports provided to Bantjies mid-June"
- **Follow with:** "Cards cancelled next day"
- **Conclude:** "Peter created the problem he complains about"

### When Questioned About Credibility
- **Cite:** Rynette email control (Sage screenshots)
- **State:** Peter does not use computers
- **Conclude:** Perjury in affidavit regarding email receipt

---

## Counter-Arguments and Responses

### "The delay was for investigation"
**Response:** "If investigation was needed, why claim urgent need for immediate interdict? The delay proves there was no urgent threat requiring ex parte relief."

### "The settlement is irrelevant"
**Response:** "Filing interdict 8 days after settlement is signed creates negotiating leverage. The timing correlation is probative of motive and demonstrates strategic litigation."

### "Peter acted in good faith"
**Response:** "Good faith requires disclosure. Peter's affidavit contains multiple material non-disclosures: email control, self-created crisis, settlement timing, Bantjies' knowledge of crimes. These omissions negate any claim of good faith."

### "Documentation was inadequate"
**Response:** "The timeline proves Peter made documentation inadequate. Cards were cancelled immediately after reports were provided to the accountant. Peter manufactured the documentation crisis, then used it as pretext for the interdict."
