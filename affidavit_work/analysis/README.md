**Key Timeline Arguments:**

1. **Urgency Contradiction**
   - 2-month delay: June → August 2025
   - Argument: Inconsistent with genuine emergency

2. **Strategic Timing**
   - 8-day gap: Settlement → Interdict
   - Argument: Litigation tool for settlement leverage

3. **Self-Created Crisis**
   - Next-day timeline: Reports → Cards cancelled
   - Argument: Manufactured pretext for interdict

4. **Information Manipulation**
   - Ongoing: Rynette email control (June 20, August 25)
   - Argument: Peter's affidavit contains perjury

5. **Coordinated Perjury**
   - 65-day gap: Crimes known → False affidavit
   - Argument: Bantjies committed perjury under oath

6. **Financial Motive**
