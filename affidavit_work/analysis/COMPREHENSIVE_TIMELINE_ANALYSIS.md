# Comprehensive Timeline Analysis: Peter's Bad Faith and Strategic Coordination

**Case:** 2025-137857 - Peter Faucitt v. Jacqueline Faucitt et al.  
**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate Peter's bad faith through systematic timeline analysis showing strategic coordination

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive timeline analysis documents the strategic coordination and bad faith conduct underlying Peter Faucitt's interdict application. The timeline reveals:

1. **Months-long delay** between alleged discovery of issues (June 2025) and interdict filing (August 2025), contradicting claims of urgency
2. **Strategic timing** with settlement agreement signed 2 days before interdict filing
3. **Self-created crisis** where Peter's unilateral actions (card cancellations) created the problems he later complained about
4. **Information manipulation** through Rynette Farrar's control of Pete@regima.com email
5. **Coordinated perjury** with Daniel Bantjies' confirmatory affidavit despite knowledge of criminal matters
6. **Investment payout timing** as underlying motive for control (9 months after interdict)

**Key Finding**: The timeline demonstrates this is **strategic litigation for control**, not genuine concern about business operations.

## Timeline Analysis Insights

### 1. Months-Long Delay Contradicts Urgency

**Pattern:**
- Issues allegedly discovered: **June 2025**
- Interdict filed: **August 2025**
- **Delay: 2+ months**

**Analysis:**
If Peter genuinely believed there was urgent misconduct requiring immediate Court intervention, why wait over two months to file the application? The delay is inconsistent with:
- Claims of urgent need for interdict
- Allegations of ongoing harm to business operations
- Purported concern about director misconduct

**Inference:** The delay suggests premeditation and planning, not a genuine emergency response to discovered wrongdoing.

---

### 2. Strategic Coordination: Settlement Agreement Timing

**Timeline:**
1. Settlement agreement signed: **11 August 2025**
2. Interdict filed: **13 August 2025**
3. **Gap: 2 days**

**Analysis:**
The interdict was filed just 2 days after the settlement agreement was signed. This timing is not coincidental:

- **Leverage Creation**: The interdict provides Peter with negotiating leverage in the settlement
- **Timing Correlation**: Filing immediately after settlement suggests strategic coordination
- **Pretext Evidence**: The interdict serves as a tool for settlement negotiations, not genuine business protection

**Inference:** The interdict is a strategic litigation tactic timed to coincide with settlement negotiations, demonstrating this is about **control and financial positioning**, not business operations.

---

### 3. Peter Created the Problems He Complains About

**Self-Created Crisis Timeline:**

| Peter's Action | Date | Consequence | Peter's Complaint |
|----------------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cancels all payment cards | Mid-June 2025 | Services halted, documentation access blocked | "Daniel didn't provide adequate documentation" |
| Orders Cloud IT systems removal | 22 April 2025 | Infrastructure disruption | "Systems not properly managed" |
| Restricts director access | Ongoing | Directors unable to respond to inquiries | "Directors not cooperative" |

**Analysis:**
This pattern reveals **manufactured pretext**:

1. **Peter receives reports** from Daniel via Bantjies (mid-June)
2. **Peter cancels cards** the very next day
3. **Peter creates operational chaos** through unilateral actions
4. **Peter then complains** about the chaos he created
5. **Peter uses this chaos** to justify urgent interdict

**Key Quote for Affidavit:**
> "The timing of the Applicant's conduct demonstrates premeditation. Daniel provided all reports to the accountant Mr. Bantjies in mid-June 2025. **The very next day**, the Applicant secretly cancelled all business bank cards without notice. This unilateral action halted critical services and made it impossible for Daniel to provide comprehensive documentation. The Applicant then demanded documentation, knowing his own actions had made a comprehensive response impossible. This is not the conduct of a director seeking transparency—it is manufacturing a pretext for legal action."

### 4. Information Manipulation Timeline

**Rynette's Control of Pete@regima.com:**

| Date | Evidence | Significance |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **20 June 2025** | First Sage screenshot | Rynette controls Pete@regima.com - Peter's primary business email |
| **25 August 2025** | Second Sage screenshot | Ongoing control confirmed after interdict granted |
| **All dates** | Peter's statements in affidavit | Claims direct email receipt = perjury |

**Analysis:**
Peter claims in his founding affidavit to have received emails and information directly. However:

1. **Peter does not use a computer** - All information comes through intermediaries
2. **Rynette controls Pete@regima.com** - All "Peter's emails" filtered through Rynette
3. **Peter's "knowledge" is manufactured** - Everything he "knows" came from Rynette or Bantjies
4. **Peter's affidavit contains perjury** - Claims direct receipt of information he couldn't have received directly

**Critical Insight:**
> Peter is a victim of information warfare. His actions are based entirely on intermediary-provided information. Rynette Farrar controls the information flow, creating a **high deception potential** scenario where Peter's understanding of events can be completely manipulated.

**Degrees of Separation:**
- **Peter** → receives information from:
  - **Rynette** (financial information, payment systems, email control)
  - **Bantjies** (audit information, legal advice)
  - **Technical Personnel** (IT systems, evidence)
  - **Legal Advisors** (court filings, strategy)
  - **Unknown Email Intermediary** (communication relay)

---

### 5. Confirmatory Affidavit Contamination

**Bantjies Perjury Timeline:**

| Date | Event | Legal Significance |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **10 June 2025** | Bantjies learns of criminal matters | Knowledge acquired |
| **13 August 2025** | Bantjies provides confirmatory affidavit | Support for Peter's interdict |
| **29 August 2025** | ENS Africa email: "Received, thanks Daniel" | Acknowledgment of criminal matters communication |
| **Post-29 August** | No disclosure to Court | Suppression of material information |

**Analysis:**
Daniel Jacobus Bantjies, as accountant and trustee, committed perjury:

1. **Knew of criminal matters** as of 10 June 2025 (murder, fraud, theft)
2. **Provided confirmatory affidavit** anyway on 13 August 2025
3. **Failed to disclose material information** to the Court
4. **Knowledge + false affidavit = perjury** under oath

**Additional Issue:**
As **trustee** of the family trust, Bantjies provided an affidavit **against a beneficiary** (Daniel), which constitutes:
- Breach of fiduciary duty
- Conflict of interest
- Professional misconduct

---

### 6. Investment Payout as Underlying Motive

**Financial Timeline:**

| Event | Date | Financial Impact |
|-------|------|------------------|
| Interdict granted | 19 August 2025 | Peter gains control of business operations |
| Investment payout due | **9 months later** | Significant financial distribution expected |
| Settlement negotiations | Ongoing during interdict period | Leverage created by interdict |

**Analysis:**
The timing suggests the interdict serves a financial purpose:

1. **Control seizure** 9 months before major financial event
2. **Negotiating leverage** during settlement discussions
3. **Strategic positioning** for investment payout distribution
4. **Business value manipulation** through operational disruption

**Inference:** This interdict is about **financial control and positioning** for upcoming investment payout, not about business operations or alleged misconduct.

---

## Pattern of Strategic Behavior

### The Complete Strategic Plan

1. **Information Control** (April-May 2025)
   - Remove IT infrastructure
   - Seize email control through Rynette
   - Create information asymmetry

2. **Crisis Manufacturing** (June 2025)
   - Cancel cards immediately after receiving reports
   - Create documentation access problems
   - Generate operational chaos

3. **Evidence Positioning** (June-July 2025)
   - Use routine tax season inquiries as "proof" of misconduct
   - Mischaracterize legitimate director loan as "gift"
   - Collect "evidence" from manufactured crisis

4. **Strategic Timing** (August 2025)
   - Sign settlement agreement
   - File interdict 2 days later
   - Use interdict as leverage in settlement

5. **Perjury and Concealment** (August 2025)
   - Material non-disclosures in founding affidavit
   - False claims about email receipt
   - Suppression of criminal matters through ENS Africa

6. **Financial Positioning** (9 months post-interdict)
   - Maintain control until investment payout
   - Leverage interdict in financial negotiations
   - Position for favorable distribution

### Supporting Documentary Evidence

**Email Control and Information Manipulation:**
- JF3: Sage screenshot (20 June 2025) - Rynette controls Pete@regima.com
- JF3A: Updated Sage screenshot (25 August 2025) - Ongoing control confirmed

**Financial Documentation:**
- JF6: Bank statements showing R500K payment to Dan

- Timeline showing cancellation immediately after reports provided

**Bantjies Perjury:**
- Email dated 29 August 2025: "Received, thanks Daniel"
- Confirmatory affidavit dated 13 August 2025
- Criminal matters disclosure received 10 June 2025

**Settlement Timing:**
- Settlement agreement (11 August 2025)
- Interdict filing (13 August 2025)
- 2-day gap documentation

**Responsible Person Crisis:**
- Regulatory appointment letters (37 jurisdictions)
- System access requirements for compliance
- Immediate crisis created by system access prohibition

---

## Legal Implications

### Material Non-Disclosures

Peter's founding affidavit failed to disclose:

1. **Responsible Person regulatory crisis** - Jacqueline's non-delegable legal duties
2. **Email control by Rynette** - Peter couldn't have received emails as claimed
3. **Self-created documentation crisis** - Card cancellations made compliance impossible
4. **Settlement timing** - Interdict as strategic litigation tool
5. **Bantjies' knowledge of criminal matters** - Perjury in confirmatory affidavit
6. **Investment payout timing** - Financial motive for control
7. **Historical director loan practices** - Context for R500K payment

### Perjury Elements

**Peter's Perjury:**
- Claims to have received emails directly
- Evidence proves Rynette controlled Pete@regima.com
- Peter does not use computers
- False sworn statement = perjury

**Bantjies' Perjury:**
- Knew of criminal matters (10 June 2025)
- Provided confirmatory affidavit (13 August 2025)
- Failed to disclose material information
- Knowledge + false affidavit = perjury

### Fraud Upon the Court

The ex parte interdict was obtained through:
1. Material non-disclosures
2. False representations
3. Perjured affidavits (Peter and Bantjies)
4. Suppression of evidence
5. Strategic manipulation of information

**Result:** The interdict should be **set aside as void ab initio**.

## Strategic Recommendations for Affidavit

### Use Timeline to Demonstrate Bad Faith

**Recommended Structure:**

1. **Lead with Timeline** - Present comprehensive timeline early in response
2. **Highlight Contradictions** - Use timeline to show inconsistencies in Peter's claims
3. **Demonstrate Premeditation** - Show months of planning, not emergency response
4. **Expose Self-Created Crisis** - Timeline proves Peter manufactured the problems
5. **Strategic Litigation Finding** - Conclude this is about control, not operations

### Key Timeline Points to Emphasize

**In Every Relevant Section:**
- Reference specific dates from timeline
- Show pattern of strategic behavior
- Connect events to demonstrate coordination
- Use timeline to rebut Peter's narrative

**Example Integration:**
> "The Applicant claims urgent concern about business operations, yet waited over 2 months (June to August 2025) before filing this application. During this delay, the Applicant: cancelled all business cards (June 2025), created operational chaos through unilateral actions, then used this self-created crisis as justification for the interdict. This timeline demonstrates strategic litigation, not genuine emergency response."

---

## Conclusion

This comprehensive timeline analysis reveals the true nature of Peter Faucitt's interdict application:

**Not:** A legitimate response to discovered business misconduct  
**But:** A strategically planned litigation campaign designed to:
- Seize control of business operations
- Create leverage in settlement negotiations
- Position for favorable investment payout distribution
- Manufacture pretext through self-created crises
- Suppress evidence of information manipulation and perjury

**The Timeline Proves:**
1. ✅ Months of planning and delay (inconsistent with urgency)
2. ✅ Strategic timing with settlement agreement (2 days)
3. ✅ Self-created crisis (card cancellations after reports provided)
4. ✅ Information manipulation (Rynette's email control)
5. ✅ Coordinated perjury (Bantjies' knowledge + false affidavit)
6. ✅ Financial motive (investment payout 9 months out)

**Recommendation:** This timeline should be prominently featured in the answering affidavit, with a visual diagram annexure showing the coordination and strategic timing of events. Every major section should reference relevant timeline events to demonstrate the pattern of bad faith conduct.
