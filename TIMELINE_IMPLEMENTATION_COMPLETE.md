## Legal Implications

### Strategic Litigation Context
The complete timeline demonstrates that the 2025 interdict application represents the culmination of an 8-year criminal enterprise, not an isolated business dispute:

2. **Infrastructure Capture** (2022): Distribution automation eliminates oversight, enables later manipulation
3. **Violence & Intimidation** (2023): Criminal escalation including workplace violence, witness elimination, and murder
4. **Authority Positioning** (2024): Legal system infiltration through conflicted appointments
5. **Legal Warfare** (2025): Court system weaponized for final business appropriation

### Enhanced Criminal Prosecution Support
The timeline now provides comprehensive foundation for criminal prosecution across multiple categories:
- **Murder** (Kayla Pretorius, 2023)
- **Witness Intimidation** (Liezel harassment, drug planting, 2023)
- **Financial Fraud** (R1M+ debt manipulation, revenue hijacking, 2023-2025)
- **Evidence Tampering** (audit trail destruction, system sabotage, 2025)
