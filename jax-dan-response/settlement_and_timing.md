### Section: MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE - SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND STRATEGIC TIMING

**Introduction**
The Applicant failed to disclose that a settlement agreement was reached between the parties just eight days prior to the filing of this ex parte application. This critical omission, combined with the Applicant's months-long delay in raising these issues, demonstrates a clear lack of genuine urgency and points to strategic litigation as the primary motive.

**4.1 Settlement Signed 8 Days Before Interdict**
- A formal settlement agreement, addressing many of the same financial and operational issues, was executed by all parties on [Date].
- This agreement established a clear path forward for the business and its stakeholders.
- The Applicant's sudden decision to abandon this agreement and seek an ex parte interdict without notice is indicative of bad faith.

**4.2 Investment Payout Timeline (9 months)**
- The settlement agreement included provisions related to a significant investment payout scheduled to occur nine months from the date of the agreement.
- The timing of the interdict appears strategically calculated to create leverage and potentially disrupt this payout schedule for the Applicant's benefit.

**4.3 Strategic Litigation for Leverage**
- The proximity of the interdict to the settlement signing suggests that the application was not motivated by a genuine crisis, but rather by a desire to gain a tactical advantage.
- The Applicant is using the court process to circumvent the negotiated settlement and impose unilateral control over the business.

**4.4 Absence of Genuine Urgency**
- The issues raised in the founding affidavit were known to the Applicant for several months prior to the application.
- There is no evidence of a sudden, unforeseen event that would justify the need for an ex parte order.
- The delay in bringing this application fatally undermines the claim of urgency and suggests that the Applicant is abusing the court process.
