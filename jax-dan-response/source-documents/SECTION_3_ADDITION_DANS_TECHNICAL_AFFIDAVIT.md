## Text to Insert

### 3.4

The Second Respondent, Daniel Faucitt, in his capacity as Chief Information Officer (CIO) of RegimA Worldwide Distribution, has provided a comprehensive Technical Infrastructure Affidavit (Annexure DF1) which provides detailed technical justification for all IT expenses alleged by the Applicant to be "unexplained".

### 3.4.1 Detailed Technical Architecture

The Technical Infrastructure Affidavit provides comprehensive documentation of:

(a) E-commerce platform architecture (Shopify Plus multi-store configuration, payment gateways, CDN infrastructure);

(b) International compliance systems (GDPR, PCI-DSS Level 1, product safety databases across 37 jurisdictions);

(c) Business automation platform (order management, inventory synchronization, CRM, financial reporting);

(d) Security and risk management infrastructure (cybersecurity, encryption, backup systems, disaster recovery);

(e) Cost justification with industry benchmarks demonstrating IT spend of 6-10% of revenue is standard for international e-commerce operations.

### 3.4.2 Industry Benchmark Validation

The Technical Infrastructure Affidavit demonstrates that the IT expenses complained of by the Applicant:

(a) Fall within industry-standard ranges for international e-commerce businesses (typically 5-10% of revenue, up to 12% for multi-jurisdiction operations);

(b) Are essential for regulatory compliance across 37 jurisdictions;

(c) Are necessary for business continuity and customer data protection;

(d) Are fully justified by the technical requirements of operating an international distribution business.

### 3.4.3 Peter's Creation of Documentation Gap

The Technical Infrastructure Affidavit further demonstrates how the Applicant's own actions in June 2025 (cancelling access cards and restricting system access) created the very documentation gaps he now complains about, including:

(a) Disruption of cloud storage and backup systems;

(b) Suspension of accounting software access;

(c) Termination of email services and domain registrations;

(d) Forced emergency restoration using personal funds (R50,000-R75,000) to prevent business collapse.

### 3.4.4 Expert Technical Opinion

As a qualified CIO with over 20 years of experience in information technology and international business operations, the Second Respondent's Technical Infrastructure Affidavit provides expert technical opinion on:

(a) The necessity and appropriateness of each category of IT expense;

(b) Industry benchmarks for comparable international e-commerce businesses;

(c) The technical impossibility of operating the business without the infrastructure complained of;

(d) The devastating operational and compliance impact of the interdict on IT infrastructure.
