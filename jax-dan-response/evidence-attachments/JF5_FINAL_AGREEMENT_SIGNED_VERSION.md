## CRITICAL CHANGES ANALYSIS

### 1. From Mutual to One-Sided
- Draft: Mutual releases and protections
- Final: One-sided investigation and penalties against Jacqueline/Daniel

### 2. From Resolution to Investigation
- Draft: Resolve disputes amicably
- Final: Investigate and potentially prosecute

### 3. From Acceptance to Suspicion
- Draft: No claims regarding historical transactions
- Final: All transactions subject to investigation and reversal

### 4. From 6 to 9 Months
- Timeline extended to align with investment payout

### 5. From Cooperation to Coercion
- Draft: Mutual cooperation
- Final: Forced compliance under penalty

## TIMING SIGNIFICANCE

**Critical Timeline:**
- 28 July 2025: Initial draft (mutual releases)
- 5 August 2025: Final agreement signed (investigation provisions)
- 13 August 2025: Interdict filed (8 days later)
- 19 August 2025: Interdict granted

The 8-day gap between settlement and interdict filing demonstrates:
1. Strategic planning
2. Bad faith negotiation
3. Settlement used to gather information
4. Interdict always intended

## MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE

Peter failed to disclose to the Court:
1. Settlement signed 8 days before interdict
2. He negotiated in bad faith
3. Investigation provisions in settlement
4. His unconditional release in settlement
5. 9-month timeline (matching investment payout)
