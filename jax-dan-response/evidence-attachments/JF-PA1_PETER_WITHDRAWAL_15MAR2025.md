## Key Observations

### 1. No Board Resolution
Peter's R125,000 withdrawal on 15 March 2025 was made without any board resolution, demonstrating the established informal practice.

### 2. Self-Authorization
Peter authorized his own withdrawal without seeking approval from other directors or shareholders.

### 3. Largest Withdrawal in Period
This R125,000 represents Peter's largest single withdrawal in the period under review.

### 4. Four Months Before Complaint
Peter made this withdrawal just 4 months before complaining about Daniel's R500,000 withdrawal using the identical process.

### 5. Against Credit Balance
The withdrawal was made against a substantial credit balance owed by the company to Peter.

## Material Non-Disclosure

Peter failed to disclose in his founding affidavit that:
1. He routinely made withdrawals without board resolutions
2. He made a R125,000 withdrawal just 4 months earlier using the same process
3. The informal practice was established and accepted by all directors
4. He never previously objected to this practice
