## 6. IMPACT OF INTERDICT ON OPERATIONAL CONTINUITY AND COMPLIANCE

### 6.1 Immediate Operational Impacts

The interdict granted to Peter Faucitt creates immediate and severe operational disruptions:

**6.1.1 System Access Paralysis**

The interdict prevents me from:

- Accessing company bank accounts to pay critical IT service subscriptions
- Authorizing payments for domain renewals, hosting, security services
- Managing user access and permissions across business systems
- Responding to security incidents and system failures
- Performing routine system maintenance and updates

**Consequence**: Risk of cascading system failures as subscriptions lapse and services are suspended.

**6.1.2 Payment Processing Jeopardy**

Without access to business accounts and systems:

- Payment gateway subscriptions may lapse, halting all online sales
- PCI-DSS compliance may be compromised, requiring payment processing suspension
- Customer transactions may fail, causing immediate revenue loss
- Refund processing becomes impossible, violating consumer protection laws

**Consequence**: Complete halt of e-commerce operations and revenue generation.

**6.1.3 Customer Service Breakdown**

The interdict prevents:

- Responding to customer technical inquiries and order issues
- Processing returns and refunds through business systems
- Accessing customer data to verify orders and shipping
- Managing customer communications through business email systems

**Consequence**: Customer satisfaction collapse, negative reviews, brand damage.

### 6.2 Compliance Violations and Legal Liability

**6.2.1 GDPR and Data Protection Compliance**

The interdict creates immediate GDPR compliance violations:

- **Data subject access requests (DSARs)**: Unable to respond within 30-day legal deadline
- **Data breach response**: Unable to report breaches within 72-hour legal requirement
- **Privacy rights fulfillment**: Cannot process deletion requests, correction requests, or data portability requests
- **Data protection impact assessments**: Cannot maintain required compliance documentation

**Legal Consequence**: Fines up to **â‚¬20 million or 4% of global revenue** for GDPR violations.

**6.2.2 PCI-DSS Compliance Failures**

The interdict prevents:

- **Quarterly vulnerability scans**: Required every 90 days for PCI-DSS compliance
- **Security monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and incident response
- **Access control management**: Regular review and updates of system permissions
- **Security patch application**: Critical updates to prevent vulnerabilities

**Legal Consequence**: **Loss of authorization to process credit card payments**, effectively shutting down e-commerce operations.

**6.2.3 Responsible Person Compliance Crisis**

The interdict prevents Jacqueline (and by extension, me as her IT support) from:

- **Accessing product safety databases**: Required for regulatory inquiries and inspections
- **Responding to consumer safety inquiries**: 24-hour response requirement in some jurisdictions
- **Managing product recalls**: If safety issues are identified
- **Maintaining CPNP registrations**: Annual renewals and updates required
- **Updating Product Information Files (PIFs)**: Required for formula changes or new markets

**Legal Consequence**: Market access loss in **37 jurisdictions**, potential fines of **â‚¬10,000 to â‚¬1,000,000 per jurisdiction**, and personal criminal liability for Jacqueline.

**6.2.4 Tax Compliance Failures**

The interdict prevents:

- **SARS e-filing**: Monthly VAT returns and other tax submissions
- **International tax reporting**: Compliance in 37 jurisdictions with varying requirements
- **Financial record keeping**: Access to accounting systems for tax documentation
- **Audit cooperation**: Ability to provide records for tax authority inquiries

**Legal Consequence**: Tax penalties, interest charges, potential criminal prosecution for non-compliance.

### 6.3 Financial Impact and Business Destruction

**6.3.1 Immediate Revenue Loss**

The interdict causes immediate financial harm:

- **Payment processing suspension**: R2-4 million monthly revenue at risk
- **Domain expiration**: Loss of website access and customer traffic
- **Email suspension**: Lost sales opportunities and customer communications
- **International market lockout**: R15-30 million annual revenue from 37 jurisdictions

**Estimated monthly revenue loss**: R3-6 million due to interdict-caused system disruptions.

**6.3.2 Long-Term Business Viability**

Sustained interdict effects will destroy the business:

- **Customer base erosion**: Customers switch to competitors due to service failures
- **Regulatory blacklisting**: Loss of market access in multiple jurisdictions
- **Supplier relationship breakdown**: Inability to pay vendors and maintain relationships
- **Employee departure**: Key staff leave due to operational chaos and uncertainty
- **Brand destruction**: Reputation damage from service failures and compliance violations

**Estimated timeline to business death**: 3-6 months of sustained system access restrictions.

**6.3.3 Personal Financial Liability**

The interdict exposes me to significant personal financial risk:

- **Emergency service payments**: Already spent R50,000-R75,000 from personal funds
- **Ongoing service maintenance**: Additional R30,000-R50,000 monthly from personal funds to maintain critical services
- **Legal liability**: Potential personal liability for compliance failures if I cannot maintain systems
- **Career damage**: Reputation harm as CIO if business collapses due to preventable system failures

### 6.4 Impossibility of Alternative Arrangements

**6.4.1 Technical Requirements for CIO Role**

The role of CIO cannot be performed without:

- **System access**: Administrative privileges across all technology platforms
- **Financial authority**: Ability to authorize payments for critical IT services
- **Vendor relationships**: Direct communication and contract management with service providers
- **Emergency response capability**: Immediate action authority for security incidents and outages

**Conclusion**: The interdict makes it **impossible** for me to fulfill my fiduciary duties as CIO.

**6.4.2 Dependence on My Expertise**

RegimA's technology infrastructure is:

- **Complex**: Requires deep technical knowledge and experience
- **Customized**: Proprietary integrations and configurations I personally designed
- **Documented by me**: System architecture and procedures I created and maintain
- **Relationship-dependent**: Vendor relationships I personally established and manage

**Conclusion**: No alternative person can immediately assume my responsibilities without significant knowledge transfer and system access.

**6.4.3 Time-Sensitivity of IT Operations**

IT operations require immediate response to:

- **Security incidents**: Minutes or hours response time required
- **Payment failures**: Same-day resolution to prevent service suspensions
- **Customer issues**: Real-time troubleshooting for order and payment problems
- **System outages**: Immediate restoration to prevent revenue loss

**Conclusion**: Any delay in IT response creates cascading failures and compounds damage.

## 7. CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY

### 7.1 Technical Necessity of IT Expenses

All IT expenses questioned by Peter Faucitt are:

1. **Necessary for business operations**: Cannot conduct e-commerce without these systems
2. **Industry-standard**: Spending levels consistent with comparable businesses

4. **Cost-effective**: ROI analysis shows strong financial justification
5. **Well-documented**: Invoices, contracts, and system documentation available

### 7.2 Peter's Creation of Documentation Problem

The documentation gaps complained of by Peter were directly caused by:

1. **His unilateral card cancellations**: Suspended cloud storage and accounting systems
2. **His access restrictions**: Prevented retrieval of bank and financial records

3. **Threatens business destruction**: Revenue loss, regulatory penalties, customer attrition
4. **Exposes directors to personal liability**: Compliance failures and fiduciary breaches forced by interdict
5. **Cannot be mitigated**: No alternative arrangements possible given technical complexity and time sensitivity

### 7.5 Requested Relief

Based on the facts presented in this affidavit, I respectfully request that the Court:

1. **Set aside the interdict**: Peter's material non-disclosures and creation of the problem he complains about justify setting aside the ex parte order
2. **Restore system access**: Allow me to fulfill my CIO responsibilities and comply with legal obligations
3. **Award costs**: Compensate for personal funds expended and legal costs incurred
4. **Protective measures**: Prevent Peter from further unilateral actions that harm the businesses
