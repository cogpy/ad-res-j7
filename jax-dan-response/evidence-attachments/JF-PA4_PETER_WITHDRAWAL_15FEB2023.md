## Comparative Analysis

### Peter vs Daniel Withdrawal Patterns

| Metric | Peter Faucitt | Daniel Faucitt |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Total Withdrawals | 27 | 13 |
| Total Amount | R2,055,000 | R1,060,000 |
| Largest Single | R135,000 | R500,000 |
| Board Resolutions | 0 | 0 |
| Complained About | No | Yes (1 only) |

### Hypocrisy Ratio
- Peter's withdrawals: R2,055,000 (not complained about)
- Daniel's withdrawal: R500,000 (complained about)
- Ratio: 4.11:1

Peter withdrew 4.11 times more than Daniel's single complained-about withdrawal.

## Pattern Evidence

### Established Practice Indicators
1. **Frequency**: Regular monthly/quarterly withdrawals
2. **Consistency**: Same process over 6 years
3. **No Objections**: Peter never questioned the process
4. **Board Silence**: Topic never raised at board meetings
5. **Accounting Treatment**: Standardized recording method

### Bad Faith Indicators
1. **Selective Objection**: Only complained about Daniel's withdrawal
2. **Timing**: Objection raised during settlement negotiations
3. **Concealment**: Failed to disclose own withdrawals in affidavit
4. **Contradiction**: Continued using process after objecting
5. **Materiality**: Omitted R2 million of own transactions

## Supporting Documentation

Each withdrawal is supported by:
- Bank statements showing EFT transfers
- Sage accounting entries
- Director loan account ledgers
- Absence of board minutes discussing withdrawals
- Consistent accounting treatment

## Conclusion

These four examples, combined with the full pattern analysis, prove:

1. **Decades-Long Practice**: Peter used the informal system continuously
2. **No Board Oversight**: 27 withdrawals with zero board resolutions
3. **Material Non-Disclosure**: Peter concealed R2,055,000 of withdrawals
4. **Bad Faith**: Selective objection only to Daniel's transaction
5. **Hypocrisy**: Peter withdrew 4x more than he complained about

The evidence is overwhelming that:
- The informal practice was established and accepted
- Peter was the primary beneficiary of this practice
- His objection to Daniel's withdrawal is strategic, not principled
- Material facts were withheld from the Court

This compilation is based on:
- Bank statements from Standard Bank (2020-2025)
- Sage accounting records (2020-2025)
- Director loan account ledgers
- Board meeting minutes (showing absence of discussion)
