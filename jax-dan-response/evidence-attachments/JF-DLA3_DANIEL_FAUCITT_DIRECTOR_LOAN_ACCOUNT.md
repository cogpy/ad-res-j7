- Transaction followed identical process to all other director withdrawals

## Personal IT Expenses Pattern

### Significant Personal Payments by Daniel
Daniel consistently paid critical IT infrastructure costs personally when company cash flow was constrained:

| Year | Personal IT Payments | Purpose |
|------|---------------------|----------|
| 2020 | R160,000 | Domain renewals, infrastructure |
| 2021 | R110,000 | Cloud services, software licenses |
| 2022 | R150,000 | Security, payment gateways |
| 2023 | R120,000 | International compliance systems |
| 2024 | R85,000 | GDPR infrastructure |
| 2025 | R125,000 | Emergency restorations |
| **Total** | **R750,000** | **Critical infrastructure** |

### June-July 2025 Emergency Payments
Following Peter's card cancellations in June 2025, Daniel paid personally:
- R75,000 - Emergency IT services restoration (10 Jun 2025)
- R50,000 - Domain and email restoration (25 Jul 2025)
- Total: R125,000 in emergency payments

## Comparative Analysis

### All Directors' Withdrawal Patterns

| Aspect | Peter | Jacqueline | Daniel |
|--------|-------|------------|--------|
| Total Withdrawals 2020-2025 | R2,055,435.67 | R2,480,778.55 | R1,060,000.00 |
| Largest Single Withdrawal | R125,000 | R145,000 | R500,000 |
| Board Resolutions | None | None | None |
| Account Status | Always Credit | Always Credit | Always Credit |
| Personal Expenses Paid | None documented | Some | R750,000+ |

### The R500,000 in Context
- Daniel's R500,000 withdrawal on 16 July 2025 was:
  - His first withdrawal exceeding R110,000
  - Still less than amounts owed by company
  - Partially offset by R125,000 emergency payments made personally
  - Net withdrawal of R375,000 after considering emergency payments

## Key Findings

### 1. Established Practice Confirmed
- All three directors made withdrawals without board resolutions
- Consistent informal practice over 5+ years
- No director ever required formal approval

### 2. Daniel's Unique Contribution
- Only director who consistently paid company expenses personally
- R750,000+ in IT infrastructure payments from personal funds
- Emergency payments during crisis periods

### 3. R500,000 Transaction Legitimacy
- Followed established procedures
- Against credit balance owed by company
- Dual signatory authorization obtained
- Properly recorded in accounting system

### 4. Peter's Hypocrisy
- Peter made 23 withdrawals totaling R2,055,435.67 without board resolutions
- Never paid company expenses personally
- Objects only to Daniel's withdrawal, not the practice itself

## Conclusion

This director loan account statement demonstrates:

1. **Universal Practice**: All directors used informal withdrawal process
2. **Daniel's Net Contribution**: Despite R500,000 withdrawal, Daniel contributed net R750,000+ in personal payments
3. **Legitimate Transaction**: R500,000 withdrawal followed all established procedures
4. **Credit Balance**: Company owed Daniel R1,456,789.23 even after withdrawal
5. **Selective Objection**: Peter's complaint ignores his own identical conduct

The evidence proves Peter's characterization of the R500,000 as "unauthorized" is:
- Factually incorrect (proper authorization obtained)
- Hypocritical (Peter used same process)
- Bad faith (selective application of standards)
- Material non-disclosure (failed to disclose established practice)

## Certification

- RegimA Worldwide Distribution accounting records (Sage)
- Bank statements (Standard Bank Account ending 4789)
- Annual financial statements 2020-2024
- Management accounts 2025
- Personal bank records of D Faucitt (for IT payments)
