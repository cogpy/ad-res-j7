## Impact Statement

### Personal Reflection
"I sacrificed everything to build this business - my savings, my health, my time with family, lucrative career opportunities. I did it because I believed in the vision and wanted to create something lasting for the family. To see it destroyed in 8 days by my own father is beyond devastating. It's not just the financial loss, it's the betrayal of 8 years of sacrifice."

### Professional Assessment
"In my 30 years of evaluating business leaders, I've rarely seen the level of personal commitment Daniel showed. The financial sacrifices alone exceed R12 million, but the true cost in terms of health, relationships, and opportunities foregone is immeasurable. The contrast between this dedication and the wanton destruction is shocking."
