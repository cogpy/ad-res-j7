# Section 1: The Ongoing Financial Hemorrhage - Jax's Affidavit

## THE HIDDEN FINANCIAL CRISIS NOT DISCLOSED TO THE COURT

Since the interdict was granted, the Second Respondent and I have been paying approximately **R100,000 per month** from personal funds to maintain critical business infrastructure, while receiving **NO revenue** due to the hijacking of our customer base and payment systems.

### Monthly Personal Expenses (Ongoing Since Interdict)

**Critical Infrastructure Costs:**
- Shopify multi-year contracts: **R45,000/month**
- Microsoft enterprise agreements: **R15,000/month**  
- AWS infrastructure: **R20,000/month**
- Domain and hosting: **R5,000/month**
- Other critical services: **R15,000/month**

**Total Monthly Personal Bleeding: R100,000**

### The Unsustainable Reality

**Duration:** Ongoing since interdict granted
**Total Personal Loss:** R200,000+ and growing daily
**Revenue Received:** **R0** - All hijacked by criminal enterprise
**Contract Commitments:** Multi-year agreements spanning decades

### Multi-Year Contract Trap

These are not month-to-month services that can be easily cancelled:
- **Shopify Plus Enterprise**: 3-year commitment 
- **Microsoft Enterprise Agreement**: 5-year commitment
- **AWS Reserved Instances**: 3-year commitment
- **Domain registrations**: Pre-paid for multiple years
- **Security services**: Annual commitments

**Combined Impact:** We are trapped in long-term commitments while criminals collect all revenue.

### The Criminal Enterprise Benefits

While we bleed R100,000/month personally:
1. **Rynette's son's companies** collect all customer revenue
2. **Infrastructure remains operational** for their benefit
3. **We cannot access** evidence or systems to stop the bleeding
4. **Criminals operate with impunity** while we face financial ruin

### Evidence Supporting This Crisis

**Annexure JF-BLEEDING-1:** Personal bank statements showing R100,000/month payments
**Annexure JF-BLEEDING-2:** Multi-year contract documentation (20-year business relationships)
**Annexure JF-BLEEDING-3:** Company bank statements showing NO incoming revenue
**Annexure JF-BLEEDING-4:** Infrastructure vendor invoices requiring personal payment
**Annexure JF-BLEEDING-5:** Emergency payment notifications from suspended services

### The Interdict's Devastating Impact

**Before Interdict:**
- Company revenue funded infrastructure
- Normal business operations
- Access to financial systems and documentation

**After Interdict:**
- ALL revenue redirected to Rynette's family enterprises
- Personal funds required to prevent total collapse
- Locked out of systems needed to restore revenue flow
- Bleeding R100,000/month with no end in sight

### Immediate Consequences of Continued Bleeding

**Financial Ruin Timeline:**
- Month 1-2: Personal savings depleted (current state)
- Month 3-4: Credit facilities exhausted
- Month 5-6: Asset liquidation required
- Month 6+: Personal insolvency while criminals profit

**Business Destruction:**
- Infrastructure collapse if payments stop
- Total loss of 20+ year business relationships
- Customer data permanently lost to criminals
- Irreversible destruction of legitimate business

### The Court Was Deceived

The Applicant sought this interdict claiming:
- We were the threat to the businesses
- Urgent relief was required
- Business protection was necessary

**The Reality:**
- **We are personally funding** the businesses at R100,000/month
- **We receive no revenue** due to criminal hijacking
- **The real threat** is the Rynette/Adderory criminal enterprise
- **The interdict protects** the criminals, not the businesses

### System Access Crisis

The interdict prevents us from:
1. **Accessing payment systems** to restore legitimate revenue flow
2. **Implementing security measures** to stop customer data theft
3. **Gathering evidence** of the criminal enterprise operation
4. **Responding to compliance obligations** across 37 jurisdictions
5. **Protecting customers** from ongoing fraud

### The Responsible Person Crisis

As the designated Responsible Person under EU Regulation 1223/2009 across **37 international jurisdictions**, I am personally liable for:
- Product safety compliance
- Regulatory reporting within 24-48 hour timeframes
- Safety recall implementation
- Customer inquiry responses

**The interdict blocks my ability to fulfill these non-delegable legal duties**, exposing the business to penalties of €10,000-€1,000,000 per jurisdiction per violation.

### Relief Required

**Immediate Financial Relief:**
1. **Set aside the interdict** to stop the R100,000/month bleeding
2. **Restore access** to revenue collection systems
3. **Freeze criminal enterprise accounts** to preserve stolen revenue
4. **Emergency forensic accounting** to trace redirected funds

**System Access Relief:**
1. **Restore administrative access** to all business systems
2. **Implement audit trail preservation** to prevent further evidence destruction
3. **Enable compliance system access** for Responsible Person duties
4. **Protect customer data** from further criminal exploitation

**Evidence Preservation Relief:**
1. **Preserve all Rynette/Adderory communications** 
2. **Freeze all related bank accounts** and transaction records
3. **Secure all domain registration** and hosting records
4. **Protect remaining Shopify** audit trails from destruction

### The Smoking Gun

**Every day the interdict remains in force:**
- We lose another R3,333 personally (R100,000 ÷ 30 days)
- Criminals profit from stolen customer revenue
- Evidence is destroyed or concealed
- Regulatory violations accumulate
- The legitimate business moves closer to irreversible destruction

**The interdict is not protecting the businesses - it is enabling their systematic criminal hijacking while forcing the legitimate owners into personal financial ruin.**

### Quantified Harm Analysis

**Personal Financial Harm:**
- Current loss: R200,000+ and growing
- Projected 6-month loss: R600,000
- Projected 12-month loss: R1,200,000

**Business Harm:**
- Revenue redirection: R2,940,000 - R6,880,000 (based on historical platform revenue)
- Customer database theft: Incalculable long-term value
- Regulatory penalties: Up to R370,000,000 (37 jurisdictions × R10,000,000 max penalty)
- Infrastructure collapse: R4,860,000 - R7,340,000 annual value

**Criminal Enterprise Benefit:**
- Stolen revenue: R2,940,000 - R6,880,000
- Free infrastructure use: R100,000/month
- Customer acquisition: Thousands of redirected customers
- Competition elimination: Strategic Logistics destruction

### Conclusion

This affidavit reveals the devastating reality concealed from the Court:
1. **We are the victims**, not the perpetrators
2. **We are bleeding R100,000/month** personally while criminals profit
3. **The interdict enables** the criminal enterprise operation
4. **Immediate intervention** is required to prevent irreversible harm

The interdict must be set aside immediately, criminal enterprise assets must be frozen, and a comprehensive forensic investigation must begin.

**I am personally losing R3,333 every day this interdict remains in force, while the criminals who deceived this Court continue to profit from their systematic business hijacking.**
