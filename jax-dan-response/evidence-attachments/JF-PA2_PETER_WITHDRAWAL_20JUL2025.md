## Critical Timing Analysis

### Chronology of Events
1. **16 July 2025**: Daniel's R500,000 withdrawal (complained about)
2. **20 July 2025**: Peter's R120,000 withdrawal (4 days later)
3. **5 August 2025**: Peter first raises objection to Daniel's withdrawal
4. **14 August 2025**: Peter files founding affidavit

### Key Observation
**Peter made his own R120,000 withdrawal without board resolution just 4 DAYS AFTER Daniel's R500,000 withdrawal that he later complained about.**

## Comparison Analysis

| Aspect | Peter's R120,000 (20 Jul 2025) | Daniel's R500,000 (16 Jul 2025) |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Board Resolution | None | None |
| Days Apart | +4 days | Reference date |
| Approval Process | Self-authorized | Dual signatory |
| Complaint Filed | No complaint | Peter complained |
| Process Used | Identical | Identical |

## Evidence of Bad Faith

### 1. Immediate Hypocrisy
Peter used the exact same process he would complain about just 4 days later, demonstrating he accepted the practice at the time.

### 2. Delayed Objection
Peter waited 16 days after Daniel's withdrawal (and 12 days after his own) before raising any objection.

### 3. Selective Application
Peter applied different standards to identical transactions based solely on who benefited.

### 4. Continued Participation
By making his own withdrawal after Daniel's, Peter affirmed the ongoing validity of the informal practice.

## Material Non-Disclosure

In his founding affidavit, Peter failed to disclose:
1. He made a R120,000 withdrawal 4 days after Daniel's R500,000 withdrawal
2. He used the identical process without board resolution
3. He raised no contemporaneous objection to the practice
4. He continued to participate in the informal system
