# Section 2: The Rynette Criminal Enterprise - Evidence of Systematic Business Hijacking

## EVIDENCE OF SYSTEMATIC BUSINESS HIJACKING BY NON-DIRECTOR

The following timeline reveals a coordinated scheme by Ms. Rynette Farrar (a non-director) to hijack the RegimA businesses through her son's companies, culminating in complete customer and revenue redirection.

### Phase 1: The Criminal Enterprise Setup (April 2021)

**Premeditated Company Structure Creation:**

Ms. Rynette Farrar's son incorporated **three companies in 16 days**:
- **Luxury Products Online (Pty) Ltd** - April 14, 2021
- **Luxure (Pty) Ltd** - April 29, 2021  
- **Adderory (Pty) Ltd** - April 30, 2021

**Annexure JF-CIPC-1:** Company registration documents showing coordinated timing
**Annexure JF-CIPC-2:** Director and shareholder information
**Annexure JF-CIPC-3:** Registered address analysis (same family properties)

**Pattern Analysis:** Three companies in 16 days demonstrates systematic pre-planning, not organic business development.

### Phase 2: Business Infiltration (2021-2025)

**Strategic Positioning for Control:**

**2.1 Supplier Infiltration (Conflict of Interest)**
- Adderory becomes preferred supplier to RegimA companies
- Rynette, as non-director employee, processes Adderory's invoices
- **Self-dealing:** Processing payments to her son's company

**Annexure JF-SUPPLIER-1:** Adderory invoices processed by Rynette
**Annexure JF-SUPPLIER-2:** Supplier preference documentation
**Annexure JF-SUPPLIER-3:** Payment authorization records

**2.2 Competition Elimination (Anti-Competitive Conduct)**
- Strategic Logistics (Daniel's company) forced to sell at below-cost prices
- Adderory given preferential pricing and terms
- Systematic destruction of legitimate competition

**Annexure JF-COMPETITION-1:** Below-cost sale documentation
**Annexure JF-COMPETITION-2:** Adderory preferential treatment evidence
**Annexure JF-COMPETITION-3:** Strategic Logistics financial deterioration

**2.3 Asset Stripping (Systematic Theft)**
- Millions in stock "disappear" through unexplained journal entries
- Inventory adjustments without proper authorization
- Materials redirected to benefit Adderory operations

**Annexure JF-JOURNAL-1:** Suspicious stock adjustments written off by Rynette
**Annexure JF-JOURNAL-2:** Journal entry patterns analysis
**Annexure JF-JOURNAL-3:** Missing inventory documentation

### Phase 3: The Business Hijacking (April-June 2025)

**Coordinated Takeover Execution:**

**3.1 Financial Control Seizure (April 14, 2025)**
- Rynette unilaterally changes company bank accounts
- Redirects all incoming payments to accounts under her control
- Blocks legitimate directors from financial access

**Annexure JF-BANK-CHANGE-1:** Rynette's bank change authorization letter
**Annexure JF-BANK-CHANGE-2:** Bank confirmation of account changes
**Annexure JF-BANK-CHANGE-3:** Payment redirection evidence

**3.2 Evidence Destruction (May 22, 2025)**
- **ALL Shopify audit trails destroyed** across 30+ stores
- Complete elimination of transaction history
- Prevents forensic analysis of revenue flows

**Annexure JF-SHOPIFY-DESTRUCTION-1:** Evidence of audit trail deletion
**Annexure JF-SHOPIFY-DESTRUCTION-2:** System access logs
**Annexure JF-SHOPIFY-DESTRUCTION-3:** Technical analysis of data destruction

**3.3 Domain Hijacking (May 29, 2025)**
- **Regimaskin.co.za domain registered by Adderory**
- Designed to capture RegimA customer traffic
- Creates confusion with legitimate regima.zone domain

**Annexure JF-WHOIS-1:** Domain registration showing Adderory ownership
**Annexure JF-WHOIS-2:** Registration timing analysis
**Annexure JF-WHOIS-3:** Domain similarity analysis for customer confusion

**3.4 Customer Redirection (June 20, 2025)**
- Customers instructed to use regimaskin.co.za instead of regima.zone
- Complete hijacking of customer database and relationships
- Revenue flows redirected to criminal enterprise

**Annexure JF-CUSTOMER-REDIRECT-1:** Instructions to use regimaskin.co.za
**Annexure JF-CUSTOMER-REDIRECT-2:** Customer confusion documentation
**Annexure JF-CUSTOMER-REDIRECT-3:** Revenue flow redirection evidence

### The Criminal Enterprise Structure

**4.2 The Adderory Integration**
- **Supplier Relationship:** Becomes preferred RegimA supplier
- **Invoice Processing:** Rynette processes Adderory invoices (conflict)
- **Domain Ownership:** Registers competing customer capture domain
- **Revenue Collection:** Channels RegimA customers to Adderory platform

**4.3 The Cover-Up Operation**
- **Evidence Destruction:** Systematic elimination of audit trails
- **Documentation Disruption:** Card cancellations prevent record access
- **System Lockout:** Prevents legitimate directors from gathering evidence
- **Legal Maneuver:** Interdict application to protect criminal operation

- Reality: Respondents are victims of systematic criminal hijacking
- Court granted relief to protect businesses
- Reality: Relief protects criminal enterprise operation

### Quantified Criminal Enterprise Benefits

**6.1 Revenue Theft:**
- Estimated redirected revenue: R2,940,000 - R6,880,000
- Based on historical RegimA platform performance
- Now flowing to regimaskin.co.za (Adderory domain)

**6.2 Asset Stripping:**

### Evidence Preservation Emergency

**Critical Evidence at Risk:**
1. **Rynette's Communications:** Instructions for criminal coordination
2. **Adderory Financial Records:** Evidence of stolen revenue processing
3. **Bank Account Changes:** Documentary proof of financial hijacking
4. **Customer Redirection Records:** Proof of business theft
5. **Remaining System Logs:** What hasn't been destroyed yet

**Preservation Orders Required:**
- Freeze all Adderory/Luxure/Luxury Products Online accounts
- Preserve all Rynette's communications and instructions
- Secure all domain registration and hosting records
- Protect customer database access logs
- Prevent further Shopify audit trail destruction

### The Criminal Referral Requirement

**Charges to be Filed:**
1. **Fraud:** Systematic deception in business operations
2. **Theft:** Customer database and revenue redirection
3. **Racketeering:** Coordinated criminal enterprise operation
4. **Money Laundering:** Processing stolen revenue through family companies
5. **Anti-Competitive Conduct:** Elimination of legitimate competition

**Commercial Crimes Unit Investigation Required:**
- Trace all revenue flows from RegimA to criminal enterprise
- Analyze journal entry patterns for systematic theft
- Investigate bank account changes and authorization
- Examine domain registration coordination timing
- Assess customer redirection impact and damages

### The Smoking Gun Evidence

**Coordination Proof:**
- Company incorporation timing (16 days, April 2021)
- Supplier infiltration followed by customer hijacking
- Evidence destruction immediately before customer redirection
- Domain registration timing with hijacking execution
- Revenue redirection coordinated with interdict application

**This is not a business dispute - this is documented criminal enterprise operation with systematic coordination, evidence destruction, and ongoing theft totaling millions of rands.**

### Conclusion

The evidence reveals a sophisticated criminal enterprise operating over 4 years:
1. **Setup Phase:** Coordinated company incorporation (April 2021)
2. **Infiltration Phase:** Supplier positioning and competition elimination (2021-2025)
3. **Hijacking Phase:** Systematic business takeover (April-June 2025)
4. **Protection Phase:** Interdict application to prevent investigation

**The interdict is not protecting legitimate businesses - it is enabling a criminal enterprise to operate with impunity while destroying the legitimate owners financially and preventing evidence gathering for prosecution.**

**Immediate relief required:** Set aside interdict, freeze criminal enterprise assets, preserve evidence, refer for criminal prosecution.
