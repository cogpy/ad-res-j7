## Comparison to Daniel's Transaction

| Aspect | Peter's Withdrawals | Daniel's Withdrawal |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Board Resolution | None | None |
| Approval Process | Director instruction | Director instruction |
| Accounting Treatment | Director loan account | Director loan account |
| Documentation | Bank transfer records | Bank transfer records |
| Signatory Authority | Established | Established |

## Conclusion

This director loan account statement demonstrates:

1. **Established Practice**: Peter routinely withdrew funds without board resolutions
2. **Identical Treatment**: Daniel's R500,000 withdrawal followed same process
3. **No Distinction**: Peter never required formal approval for his withdrawals
4. **Inconsistent Objection**: Peter's complaint about Daniel's withdrawal contradicts his own conduct
5. **Material Non-Disclosure**: Peter failed to disclose his participation in this practice

The evidence conclusively shows Peter accepted and utilized the informal director loan account practice for years, making his objection to Daniel's identical transaction both hypocritical and indicative of bad faith.
