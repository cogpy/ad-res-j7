### The Platform Ownership Counter-Claim

**RegimA Zone Ltd Platform Costs:**

**Revenue Generated on Daniel's Platform:**
- **RWD Revenue:** R2,940,000 - R6,880,000 generated on Daniel's platform
- **Platform Fees:** Never paid to platform owner
- **Unjust Enrichment:** Peter questions R500,000 while ignoring millions in unpaid platform usage

**The Irony:**

- **2024:** Witnessed accelerated Strategic Logistics destruction
- **2025:** Aware of journal entry patterns and stock disappearances
- **April 2025:** Interdict application while destruction continued

**Selective Blindness:**

### The Interdict's Role in Enabling Destruction

**How the Interdict Protects Criminal Activity:**
1. **Prevents Investigation:** Cannot access systems to gather evidence
2. **Blocks Restoration:** Cannot restore fair competition and pricing
3. **Enables Continuation:** Anti-competitive conduct continues unimpeded
4. **Protects Assets:** Criminal enterprise assets remain unfrozen

**Strategic Logistics Cannot Recover While:**
- Evidence gathering is blocked by interdict
- Anti-competitive regime continues under court protection
- Adderory continues receiving preferential treatment
- Journal entry manipulation continues without oversight

### Relief Required for Strategic Logistics

**Immediate Relief:**
1. **Set Aside Interdict:** Enable evidence gathering and business restoration
2. **Forensic Investigation:** All journal entries affecting Strategic Logistics
3. **Competition Restoration:** End Adderory preferential treatment
4. **Asset Recovery:** Trace and recover stolen materials through journal entries

**Long-Term Relief:**
1. **Damage Compensation:** Full quantification and payment of systematic losses
2. **Business Restoration:** Return to fair competition and market pricing
3. **Restitution:** Recovery of all assets stripped through journal manipulation
4. **Preventive Measures:** End conflict of interest in supplier management

### Criminal Charges Required

**Anti-Competitive Conduct:** Systematic destruction of legitimate competition
**Fraud:** Misrepresentation in supplier processing and preference
**Theft:** Asset stripping through journal entry manipulation
**Corruption:** Conflict of interest exploitation for family benefit

### Conclusion

Strategic Logistics CC has been systematically destroyed as part of the broader criminal enterprise operation. The evidence shows:

1. **Deliberate Destruction:** Anti-competitive conduct to eliminate competition
2. **Family Benefit:** All destroyed business redirected to Rynette's son's company
3. **Asset Stripping:** Millions in materials "disappeared" through journal entries
4. **System Exploitation:** Abuse of employee position for family enterprise benefit

**The interdict enables this ongoing destruction by preventing investigation and evidence gathering. Strategic Logistics cannot recover while the criminal enterprise operates under court protection.**

**Technical insolvency has been artificially created through systematic criminal conduct. Justice requires immediate intervention to stop this ongoing business destruction and asset stripping operation.**
