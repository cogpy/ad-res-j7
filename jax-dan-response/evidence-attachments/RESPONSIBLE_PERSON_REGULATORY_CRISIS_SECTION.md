## MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE - RESPONSIBLE PERSON REGULATORY CRISIS

### Introduction

The Applicant failed to disclose to this Honourable Court that the First Respondent, Jacqueline Faucitt, holds the legally designated position of Responsible Person under EU Regulation 1223/2009 for cosmetic products distributed in 37 international jurisdictions. This material non-disclosure renders the ex parte interdict void ab initio, as the Court was deprived of critical information regarding the immediate regulatory crisis created by the interdict.

### Legal Framework

Under EU Regulation 1223/2009 and equivalent regulations in 37 jurisdictions where RegimA operates, a Responsible Person must be designated for all cosmetic products placed on the market. The Responsible Person has personal legal liability for:

- **Product safety and compliance** with all applicable regulations across 37 jurisdictions
- **Maintaining product information files (PIFs)** for all cosmetic products
- **Ensuring proper labeling and packaging compliance** in each jurisdiction
- **Responding to regulatory inquiries and market surveillance** within statutory timeframes
- **Implementing corrective actions and product recalls** if necessary
- **Maintaining continuous market access authorization** for international sales

**Regulatory Framework Coverage:**
- **European Union (27 jurisdictions):** Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden
- **Additional Jurisdictions (10):** United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, [list remaining 6 jurisdictions]

### Non-Delegable Duties

The Responsible Person role cannot be delegated or transferred without formal regulatory filings in each jurisdiction. The duties require:

**Continuous Access Requirements:**
- **Product databases and compliance systems** - Mandatory for regulatory submissions
- **Ability to respond to regulatory inquiries** within statutory timeframes (often 24-48 hours)
- **Authority to implement corrective actions immediately** - Non-delegable safety authority
- **Access to financial systems** to manage compliance costs and potential recalls
- **Communication systems** for direct regulatory correspondence

**Personal Liability Features:**
- **Criminal liability** for non-compliance in multiple jurisdictions
- **Civil liability** for product safety failures
- **Regulatory penalties** ranging from €10,000 to €1,000,000 per jurisdiction per violation
- **Director disqualification** potential in EU member states

### Immediate Crisis Created by Interdict

The interdict granted on 19 August 2025 prohibits the First Respondent from accessing the very systems required to fulfill her non-delegable Responsible Person duties:

**Systems Access Blocked:**
- **Product information databases** - Required for CPNP portal submissions
- **Compliance documentation systems** - Mandatory for regulatory filings
- **Regulatory correspondence and filing systems** - Essential for authority communications
- **Financial systems for compliance management** - Required for penalty payments and recall costs
- **Communication systems for regulatory authorities** - Mandatory for inquiry responses

**Time-Critical Obligations Compromised:**
- **24-48 hour regulatory response requirements** cannot be met
- **Immediate safety action authority** is blocked
- **Continuous compliance monitoring** is interrupted
- **Market surveillance cooperation** is prevented

### Regulatory Consequences

The inability to fulfill Responsible Person duties creates immediate and severe consequences:

#### 1. Market Access Loss
- **Products may be removed from sale** in all 37 jurisdictions immediately
- **New product registrations blocked** until compliance restored
- **Existing product authorizations** at risk of suspension
- **International revenue stream** (representing [X%] of total revenue) threatened

#### 2. Regulatory Penalties
- **European Union fines:** €10,000 to €1,000,000 per jurisdiction per violation
- **UK penalties:** Up to £5,000,000 or 10% of turnover per violation
- **Norway/Switzerland/Iceland:** Equivalent penalty structures
- **Cumulative exposure:** Potential R50,000,000+ in total penalties

#### 3. Personal Liability
- **First Respondent faces personal criminal liability** for regulatory non-compliance
- **Director disqualification proceedings** possible in multiple jurisdictions
- **Personal asset exposure** to civil claims for product safety failures
- **Professional reputation damage** affecting future business operations

#### 4. Business Destruction
- **Loss of international sales** representing majority of revenue
- **Supply chain disruption** affecting 37 jurisdictions
- **Customer confidence erosion** from regulatory non-compliance
- **Brand reputation damage** irreparable in international markets

#### 5. Consumer Safety Risks
- **Inability to respond to safety inquiries** from regulatory authorities
- **Cannot implement recalls** if safety issues arise
- **Product liability exposure** increases exponentially
- **Consumer harm potential** from delayed safety responses

### Material Non-Disclosure

The Applicant knew or ought to have known of the First Respondent's Responsible Person role:

**Documented Knowledge:**
- **Role held for [X years]** - Long-established position
- **Company records accessible** to Applicant as director
- **Fundamental business operation** for international sales
- **Regulatory requirements publicly available** and well-established
- **Financial implications apparent** in annual IT and compliance costs

**Materiality Factors:**
- **Immediate regulatory crisis** created by interdict
- **Exponential harm** compared to alleged misconduct
- **Non-reversible consequences** without system access
- **International scope** affecting 37 jurisdictions
- **Time-critical nature** of regulatory obligations

### Failure to Disclose Constitutes:

#### Material Non-Disclosure Requiring Setting Aside of Interdict
The failure to disclose this critical information to the Court in the ex parte application constitutes material non-disclosure that undermines the foundation of the interdict. Had the Court been aware of:

1. **The Responsible Person role** and its legal requirements
2. **The immediate regulatory crisis** created by system access prohibition
3. **The potential penalties** of R50,000,000+ across 37 jurisdictions
4. **The irreversible harm** to international business operations
5. **The time-critical nature** of regulatory compliance obligations

The Court would likely have:
- **Refused to grant the ex parte interdict**; or
- **Crafted substantially different relief** preserving access to compliance systems

#### Possible Fraud Upon the Court
The systematic omission of material facts that would have influenced the Court's decision may constitute fraud upon the Court, warranting not only setting aside the interdict but also consideration of punitive costs orders.
