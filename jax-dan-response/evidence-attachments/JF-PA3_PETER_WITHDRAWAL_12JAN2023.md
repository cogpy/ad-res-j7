## Historical Pattern Evidence

### Peter's 2023 Withdrawals
This R120,000 withdrawal was the first of five substantial withdrawals Peter made in 2023:

| Date | Amount | Board Resolution | Running Total |
|------|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| 12 Jan 2023 | R120,000 | None | R120,000 |
| 25 Mar 2023 | R95,000 | None | R215,000 |
| 18 Sep 2023 | R110,000 | None | R325,000 |
| 10 Nov 2023 | R75,000 | None | R400,000 |
| **Total 2023** | **R400,000** | **None** | - |

### Comparative Context
- Peter's 2023 withdrawals (R400,000) were 80% of Daniel's single 2025 withdrawal
- All withdrawals made without board resolutions
- Established pattern of informal practice

## Significance of January Withdrawals

### Annual Pattern
Peter consistently made large withdrawals in January:
- January 2023: R120,000
- January 2024: R85,000 (via February)
- March 2025: R125,000

This demonstrates:
1. Regular use of director loan account for personal needs
2. Typical withdrawal amounts of R85,000-R125,000
3. No requirement for board approval regardless of amount

## Board Meeting Analysis

### January 2023 Board Meeting
- **Date**: 25 January 2023
- **Attendees**: All directors present
- **Director Loan Discussion**: None
- **Peter's Recent Withdrawal**: Not mentioned
- **Board Approval**: Not sought or given

This proves:
1. Peter didn't consider board approval necessary
2. Other directors didn't object to the practice
3. Informal system was accepted by all

## Material Non-Disclosure

Peter's founding affidavit omits:
1. His R400,000 total withdrawals in 2023 alone
2. The consistent pattern of no board resolutions
3. His larger withdrawals (R120,000) comparable to industry peers
4. The accepted informal practice over multiple years

```

## Pattern Analysis

### Withdrawal Characteristics
1. **Amount**: R120,000 matches Peter's typical large withdrawals
2. **Timing**: January withdrawal for annual personal needs
3. **Process**: Self-authorized without board involvement
4. **Documentation**: Minimal - director instruction only
5. **Accounting**: Proper recording in director loan account

### Inconsistency with Later Position
Peter's January 2023 withdrawal directly contradicts his August 2025 position that:
- Board resolutions are required for director withdrawals
- Large withdrawals need special approval
- The informal practice was improper

## Conclusion

This transaction establishes:
1. **Long-Standing Practice**: Peter used informal withdrawals throughout 2023
2. **Comparable Amounts**: Peter's withdrawals often exceeded R100,000
3. **No Board Oversight**: Peter never sought board approval
4. **Accepted System**: Board meetings ignored director loan transactions
5. **Material Omission**: Peter concealed this history in his affidavit

The evidence proves Peter's objection to Daniel's R500,000 withdrawal is:
- Inconsistent with his own conduct
- Based on selective application of standards
- Made in bad faith for strategic purposes
- Contradicted by years of contrary practice

## Certification

This documentation is based on:
- Bank statement from Standard Bank (January 2023)
- Sage accounting records
- Director loan account ledger
- Board meeting minutes (25 January 2023)
