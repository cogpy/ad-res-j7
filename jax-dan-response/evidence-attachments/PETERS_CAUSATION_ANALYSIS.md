# Peter's Causation: His Unilateral Actions Created the Problems He Complains About

**Case No:** 2025-137857  
**In the High Court of South Africa (Western Cape Division, Cape Town)**

---

## ANALYSIS: PETER FAUCITT'S SELF-CREATED CRISIS

### 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 This analysis demonstrates a critical aspect of the Applicant's case that constitutes material non-disclosure in his ex parte application: **the Applicant himself created the very problems he now complains about through his own unilateral actions**.

1.2 This pattern of conduct reveals:
   - The Applicant manufactured a crisis through card cancellations and system lockouts
   - The Applicant then used this self-created crisis as pretext for the interdict
   - The Applicant's unilateral actions violated his own fiduciary duties to the companies
   - The timing and coordination demonstrate premeditation and bad faith

1.3 This analysis addresses four key areas:
   - **Section 2**: Card Cancellations Created Documentation Gap
   - **Section 3**: System Lockouts Prevented Normal Operations  
   - **Section 4**: Self-Created Crisis Used as Pretext
   - **Section 5**: Peter's Own Fiduciary Breaches

---

## 2. CARD CANCELLATIONS CREATED DOCUMENTATION GAP (Section 5.1)

### 2.1 Timeline of Card Cancellations

2.1.1 **Mid-June 2025**: Daniel Faucitt (Second Respondent) provided all reports and documentation to the accountant, Daniel Jacobus Bantjies, during routine tax season work.

2.1.2 **The very next day (approximately 7 June 2025)**: The Applicant secretly cancelled ALL business bank cards without notice or discussion with other directors.

2.1.3 The Applicant cancelled:
   - Cards used by the Second Respondent for IT subscriptions and services
   - Cards used by the First Respondent for business operations
   - Even his own business cards ("for the sake thereof")
   - All payment methods linked to critical business services

### 2.2 Immediate Consequences of Card Cancellations

2.2.1 The card cancellations caused immediate and severe disruption to business operations:

**IT Services and Subscriptions:**
   - Shopify Plus e-commerce platform subscriptions
   - AWS/cloud hosting services
   - Microsoft 365 Business licenses
   - Adobe Creative Cloud licenses
   - Sage accounting software subscriptions
   - Payment gateway services (Stripe, PayPal, Peach Payments)

**Documentation Systems:**
   - Cloud storage services (Google Workspace, Dropbox, OneDrive)
   - Document management systems
   - Email services and communication platforms
   - Customer relationship management (CRM) systems
   - Financial reporting and analytics tools

**Domain and Website Services:**
   - Domain registrations began to lapse
   - SSL certificates expired without renewal
   - Website hosting services suspended
   - Email services terminated
   - Customer-facing systems went offline

### 2.3 Impact on Documentation Accessibility

2.3.1 **Critical Effect**: The card cancellations made it impossible for the Respondents to access the very documentation systems the Applicant would later demand access to.

2.3.2 Specific documentation impacts:
   - **Invoice Records**: Vendor invoices stored in cloud systems became inaccessible when subscriptions lapsed
   - **Email Correspondence**: Business email accounts were suspended, preventing access to vendor communications
   - **Financial Records**: Cloud-based accounting and financial systems lost connectivity
   - **Transaction History**: Payment gateway portals and merchant services became inaccessible
   - **System Logs**: Access logs and audit trails in cloud platforms were no longer reachable

### 2.4 The Applicant's Subsequent Demands

2.4.1 Following the card cancellations, the Applicant then demanded comprehensive invoices and documentation for IT expenses from the Second Respondent.

2.4.2 **The Manufactured Trap**: The Applicant created an impossible situation:
   - **Step 1**: Cancel all business cards, disrupting access to documentation systems
   - **Step 2**: Demand comprehensive documentation
   - **Step 3**: Characterize the inability to provide complete documentation (which he caused) as evidence of wrongdoing
   - **Step 4**: Use this manufactured "evidence" as basis for urgent interdict

2.4.3 The Second Respondent provided all documentation that was accessible despite these restrictions (Correspondence, Annexure JF-CORR1).

2.4.4 The Applicant then characterized these expenses as "unexplained" - a characterization that is fundamentally dishonest because:
   - The Applicant himself restricted access to documentation systems
   - The Respondents provided all available documentation
   - The Applicant never specified what additional information was required
   - The Applicant never restored access to allow comprehensive documentation gathering

### 2.5 Emergency Response by Respondents

2.5.1 To prevent complete business collapse, the Second Respondent was forced to use **personal funds (R50,000-R75,000)** to:
   - Restore critical domain registrations
   - Reinstate essential email services
   - Maintain customer-facing e-commerce systems
   - Preserve regulatory compliance platforms (GDPR, PCI-DSS)
   - Prevent data loss from cloud storage suspensions

2.5.2 This emergency expenditure by the Second Respondent:
   - Prevented customer harm and business destruction
   - Maintained regulatory compliance obligations
   - Protected company assets and data
   - Demonstrated the Respondents' commitment to business continuity

2.5.3 The Applicant later characterized these emergency restoration expenses as additional "unauthorized" spending - despite the fact that his own actions created the emergency.

### 2.6 Material Non-Disclosure

2.6.1 The Applicant failed to disclose to the Court in his ex parte application:
   - That he unilaterally cancelled all business cards in June 2025
   - That this cancellation disrupted documentation systems
   - That he demanded documentation after making it inaccessible
   - That the Respondents provided all available documentation
   - That the Respondents used personal funds to prevent business collapse
   - That the "unexplained expenses" characterization was dishonest

2.6.2 Had the Court been properly informed of these facts, the interdict would not have been granted, as it would have been clear that:
   - The Applicant created the documentation problem he complained about
   - The Respondents acted responsibly to protect the business
   - No genuine urgency existed beyond what the Applicant manufactured
   - The application was pretextual, not based on legitimate concerns

## 3. SYSTEM LOCKOUTS PREVENTED NORMAL OPERATIONS (Section 5.2)

### 3.1 Pattern of Access Restrictions

3.1.1 In addition to card cancellations, the Applicant implemented a systematic pattern of restricting the other directors' access to business systems and information.

3.1.2 **System Access Restrictions** included:
   - Financial systems and accounting software (Sage)
   - Bank account access and online banking platforms
   - Email accounts and communication systems
   - Cloud storage and document repositories
   - Customer databases and CRM systems
   - Operational management platforms

### 3.2 Impact on Business Operations

3.2.1 These access restrictions prevented the Respondents from:
   - **Financial Management**: Accessing financial records needed for informed decision-making
   - **Vendor Relations**: Communicating with suppliers and service providers
   - **Customer Service**: Responding to customer inquiries and support requests
   - **Regulatory Compliance**: Accessing systems required for regulatory reporting
   - **Documentation**: Retrieving historical records for transparency requests
   - **Operational Continuity**: Managing day-to-day business operations

3.2.2 **Responsible Person Duties**: The restrictions specifically prevented the First Respondent from fulfilling her non-delegable duties as Responsible Person under EU Regulation 1223/2009 for 37 jurisdictions, including:
   - Access to product information files (PIFs)
   - Regulatory compliance documentation
   - Safety assessment systems
   - Market surveillance response capabilities
   - Corrective action implementation systems

### 3.3 Concurrent Empowerment of Non-Director

3.3.1 While restricting director access, the Applicant simultaneously granted **unprecedented access and authority to Rynette Farrar**, a non-director bookkeeper with no fiduciary responsibility to the companies.

3.3.2 Rynette Farrar was granted:
   - Control of Pete@regima.com email account (evidence: Sage screenshots JF1, JF2)
   - Bank account signatory authority
   - Access to all business passwords and systems
   - Effective control over business communications
   - Authority to act without director oversight

3.3.3 **The Contradiction**: The Applicant simultaneously:
   - Restricted legitimate directors' access to systems (characterizing oversight as "interference")
   - Granted unrestricted access to a non-director with no fiduciary duties
   - Created a structure where directors were excluded from their own companies
   - Transferred effective control to someone with no legal responsibility

### 3.4 Characterization of Director Oversight as "Interference"

3.4.1 The Applicant characterized legitimate director oversight and governance activities as "interference" with his management.

3.4.2 This characterization reveals the Applicant's true intent:
   - To operate without director accountability
   - To prevent scrutiny of his actions
   - To centralize control while excluding other directors
   - To create a unilateral management structure inconsistent with corporate governance

3.4.3 **Director Duties**: The Respondents have fiduciary duties under the Companies Act and Close Corporations Act to:
   - Exercise oversight over company affairs
   - Ensure proper financial management
   - Protect company assets
   - Act in the best interests of the companies

3.4.4 The Applicant's characterization of these duties as "interference" demonstrates:
   - Fundamental misunderstanding of corporate governance
   - Intent to avoid accountability
   - Bad faith in his approach to shared directorship
   - Breach of his own fiduciary duties

### 3.5 Evidence of System Access Restrictions

3.5.1 **Required Evidence** (to be obtained and annexed):
   - **JF-SAL1**: System access logs showing restrictions imposed by Applicant
   - **JF-EAL1**: Email access logs demonstrating restricted access
   - **JF-FSL1**: Financial system logs evidencing access removal
   - **JF-RFA1**: Evidence of Rynette Farrar's expanding access
   - **JF-BAS1**: Bank authorization forms granting Rynette signatory authority

3.5.2 These logs will demonstrate:
   - Specific dates when directors' access was restricted
   - Systems from which directors were excluded
   - Timeline correlation with card cancellations
   - Pattern of deliberate exclusion of legitimate directors

---

## 4. SELF-CREATED CRISIS USED AS PRETEXT (Section 5.3)

### 4.1 The Manufacturing of "Urgency"

4.1.1 The Applicant's conduct follows a clear pattern of **crisis manufacturing** for pretextual litigation:

**Phase 1: Create the Problem (June 2025)**
   - Cancel all business cards
   - Restrict director access to systems
   - Disrupt documentation accessibility
   - Empower non-director with unrestricted access
   - Exclude legitimate directors from operations

**Phase 2: Exploit the Problem (July-August 2025)**
   - Demand documentation from systems he made inaccessible
   - Characterize legitimate expenses as "unexplained"
   - Claim urgency based on problems he created
   - File urgent interdict based on self-manufactured crisis

**Phase 3: Prevent Resolution (August 2025 onwards)**
   - Obtain ex parte interdict without disclosure of his causation
   - Use interdict to prevent directors from accessing systems
   - Maintain crisis state to justify ongoing relief
   - Block any attempts to restore normal operations

### 4.2 Timing Reveals Strategic Coordination

4.2.1 **Key Timeline Analysis**:

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Mid-June 2025 | Daniel provides all reports to accountant Bantjies | Respondent fully cooperative |
| 7 June 2025 | Peter secretly cancels all business cards | Day after reports provided - creates crisis |
| June-July 2025 | Services disrupted, documentation systems inaccessible | Manufactured "problem" |
| July 2025 | Peter demands documentation | Demands what he made inaccessible |
| **[Date]** | Settlement agreement signed | 8 days before interdict |
| 14 August 2025 | Peter files founding affidavit | Material non-disclosures |
| 19 August 2025 | Ex parte interdict granted | Based on false information |
| **[Date +9 months]** | Investment payout due | Underlying motive for control |

4.2.2 **The Two-Month Delay**: The Applicant allegedly "discovered" issues in June 2025 but waited until August 2025 to file the interdict. This delay:
   - Contradicts claims of genuine urgency
   - Allowed time for strategic coordination
   - Coincided with settlement negotiations
   - Demonstrates premeditation rather than reaction

### 4.3 Absence of Genuine Urgency

4.3.1 Several facts demonstrate the absence of genuine urgency:

**A. Months-Long Delay**
   - Alleged issues existed from June 2025
   - Interdict filed in August 2025
   - No explanation for 2-month delay if genuinely urgent
   - Businesses operated successfully during this period

**B. Strategic Timing**
   - Settlement agreement signed 8 days before interdict filing
   - Interdict provides leverage in settlement negotiations
   - Investment payout due within 9 months
   - Timing suggests pretext rather than genuine concern

**C. Applicant's Own Prior Conduct**
   - Participated in informal model for decades without concern
   - Never objected to similar practices when he benefited
   - Sudden objection only during settlement negotiations
   - Pattern of conduct inconsistent with genuine urgency

**D. No Attempt at Normal Resolution**
   - No request for board meeting to discuss concerns
   - No attempt to engage in good faith negotiations
   - Immediate resort to urgent ex parte relief
   - Bypassing of normal dispute resolution mechanisms

### 4.4 The Pretext of "Urgency"

4.4.1 The Applicant claimed urgent relief was necessary to:
   - Prevent further "unauthorized" transactions
   - Protect company assets
   - Ensure financial transparency
   - Address alleged mismanagement

4.4.2 **Reality**: These claims were pretextual because:
   - The Applicant created the "urgent" problems through card cancellations
   - No genuine threat existed beyond what the Applicant manufactured
   - The Respondents were acting to protect the business, not harm it
   - The real urgency was the Applicant's strategic timing for settlement leverage

4.4.3 **Alternative Remedies Available**: If the Applicant had genuine concerns, numerous alternative remedies existed:
   - Request a board meeting under Companies Act provisions
   - Engage external auditors for independent review
   - Utilize trust governance mechanisms (given his absolute trust powers)
   - Seek mediation or alternative dispute resolution
   - Request voluntary provision of information

4.4.4 The Applicant's failure to pursue any alternative remedy before seeking urgent ex parte relief demonstrates the pretextual nature of his application.

## 5. PETER'S OWN FIDUCIARY BREACHES (Section 5.4)

### 5.1 Fiduciary Duties of Directors

5.1.1 Under the Companies Act and Close Corporations Act, all directors owe fiduciary duties to the companies, including:
   - Acting in good faith in the best interests of the company
   - Exercising powers for proper purposes
   - Avoiding conflicts of interest
   - Acting with care, skill and diligence
   - Not using position for personal gain
   - Maintaining transparency and accountability

5.1.2 These duties apply equally to ALL directors, including the Applicant.

### 5.2 The Applicant's Breaches of Fiduciary Duty

5.2.1 The Applicant's conduct constitutes multiple breaches of his fiduciary duties:

#### A. Unilateral Card Cancellations (Breach: Acting Without Proper Purpose)

5.2.1.1 The cancellation of all business cards without notice or consultation:
   - Harmed the companies by disrupting operations
   - Prevented other directors from fulfilling their duties
   - Created immediate business continuity crisis
   - Was not done for the benefit of the companies
   - Served only the Applicant's personal litigation strategy

5.2.1.2 **No Legitimate Purpose**: There was no legitimate business purpose for:
   - Canceling cards held by responsible directors
   - Doing so without notice or discussion
   - Creating service disruptions and potential customer harm
   - Making documentation systems inaccessible

#### B. System Lockouts (Breach: Preventing Other Directors from Fulfilling Duties)

5.2.1.3 By restricting other directors' access to systems, the Applicant:
   - Prevented them from exercising their fiduciary duties
   - Made it impossible for them to oversee company operations
   - Blocked their access to financial information needed for informed decisions
   - Created a unilateral management structure inconsistent with corporate governance
   - Violated their rights as directors under Companies Act provisions

#### C. Empowerment of Non-Director (Breach: Improper Delegation and Conflict Creation)

5.2.1.4 Granting unrestricted access and authority to Rynette Farrar (non-director):
   - Improperly delegated fiduciary responsibilities to someone with no legal duty
   - Created a structure where non-director controlled company operations
   - Excluded legitimate directors in favor of non-director
   - Violated principles of corporate governance
   - Created conflicts of interest and accountability gaps

#### D. Refusal to Engage in Good Faith (Breach: Duty to Act in Company's Best Interest)

5.2.1.5 The Applicant's refusal to engage with other directors:
   - Prevented resolution of any genuine concerns
   - Forced immediate resort to costly litigation
   - Harmed the companies through legal fees and operational disruption
   - Prioritized personal objectives over company welfare
   - Demonstrated bad faith in handling disputes

#### E. Strategic Litigation for Personal Gain (Breach: Using Position for Personal Advantage)

5.2.1.6 The timing and nature of the interdict application demonstrates:
   - Use of directorship to gain leverage in personal settlement negotiations
   - Exploitation of company control for personal financial advantage
   - Strategic coordination with investment payout timeline
   - Prioritization of personal wealth protection over company welfare

### 5.3 Harm to Companies from Applicant's Actions

5.3.1 The Applicant's breaches of fiduciary duty caused substantial harm to the companies:

**Operational Harm:**
   - Service disruptions affecting customers
   - Vendor relationship damage
   - Staff confusion and operational paralysis
   - Emergency expenditures to restore services
   - Loss of business continuity

**Financial Harm:**
   - Legal fees for this unnecessary litigation
   - Costs of emergency service restoration
   - Lost revenue from disrupted operations
   - Potential regulatory penalties
   - Damage to business relationships and creditworthiness

**Regulatory Harm:**
   - POPIA compliance violations from communication disruptions
   - Potential GDPR violations from data access issues
   - PCI-DSS compliance risks from payment system disruptions
   - Responsible Person duty failures across 37 jurisdictions
   - Risk of product recalls and market access loss

**Reputational Harm:**
   - Customer concerns from service disruptions
   - Vendor questions about business stability
   - Regulatory attention from compliance gaps
   - Market perception of management dysfunction
   - Long-term brand damage

### 5.4 The Applicant Cannot Complain of Problems He Created

5.4.1 **Fundamental Legal Principle**: A party cannot:
   - Create a problem through his own wrongful actions
   - Then use that manufactured problem as basis for legal relief
   - Claim urgency when the urgency is self-created
   - Benefit from his own wrongdoing

5.4.2 **Application to This Case**:
   - The Applicant cancelled cards → created documentation problem → then complained about lack of documentation
   - The Applicant restricted access → prevented normal operations → then complained about operational issues
   - The Applicant excluded directors → created governance breakdown → then complained about lack of oversight
   - The Applicant manufactured crisis → then claimed urgent relief was necessary

5.4.3 **Legal Consequences**:
   - The ex parte interdict must be set aside (obtained through material non-disclosure)
   - The Applicant should bear costs personally (de bonis propriis)
   - Declaratory relief should be granted regarding the Applicant's breaches
   - The Applicant should be restrained from further vexatious litigation

### 5.5 Comparison: Respondents' Protective Actions vs. Applicant's Destructive Actions

5.5.1 **Stark Contrast in Conduct**:

| Aspect | Applicant's Actions | Respondents' Actions |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Intent** | Manufacture crisis for litigation | Protect business continuity |
| **Method** | Unilateral, secretive, destructive | Cooperative, transparent, protective |
| **Communication** | No notice, no consultation | Provided documentation, sought dialogue |
| **Financial** | Cancelled cards, disrupted services | Used personal funds to restore services |
| **Directors** | Excluded legitimate directors | Sought to fulfill fiduciary duties |
| **Companies** | Harmed through disruption | Protected through emergency measures |
| **Result** | Created problems for pretext | Prevented business collapse |

### 5.6 Evidence of Applicant's Breaches

5.6.1 **Required Evidence** (to be obtained and annexed):
   - **JF-BREACH1**: Timeline of unilateral actions without consultation
   - **JF-BREACH2**: Evidence of harm to companies from card cancellations
   - **JF-BREACH3**: Documentation of director exclusion pattern
   - **JF-BREACH4**: Financial records showing emergency restoration costs
   - **JF-BREACH5**: Customer complaints and operational disruption evidence
   - **JF-BREACH6**: Regulatory compliance risk assessments

5.6.2 This evidence will demonstrate:
   - Systematic pattern of fiduciary breaches
   - Deliberate harm to companies for personal advantage
   - Bad faith in handling directorship responsibilities
   - Contrast between Applicant's destructive and Respondents' protective actions

## 6. MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE AND LEGAL CONSEQUENCES

### 6.1 Material Non-Disclosures in Ex Parte Application

6.1.1 The Applicant failed to disclose to the Court in his ex parte application:

**Regarding Card Cancellations:**
   - That he unilaterally cancelled all business cards in June 2025
   - That this occurred the day after Daniel provided documentation to accountant
   - That cancellations disrupted documentation systems
   - That he then demanded documentation he made inaccessible
   - That Respondents used personal funds to restore services

**Regarding System Lockouts:**
   - That he restricted directors' access to systems
   - That he characterized director oversight as "interference"
   - That he simultaneously empowered non-director with unrestricted access
   - That restrictions prevented directors from fulfilling duties
   - That First Respondent's Responsible Person duties were compromised

**Regarding Self-Created Crisis:**
   - That problems complained about were caused by his own actions
   - That no genuine urgency existed beyond what he manufactured
   - That months passed between alleged "discovery" and filing
   - That settlement agreement was signed 8 days before interdict
   - That alternative remedies were available but not pursued

**Regarding His Own Breaches:**
   - That his actions violated his own fiduciary duties
   - That he harmed the companies through unilateral actions
   - That he participated in same practices for decades
   - That he is applying inconsistent standards
   - That true motive relates to settlement leverage and investment payout

### 6.2 Legal Consequences of Material Non-Disclosure

6.2.1 **Ex Parte Applications Require Utmost Good Faith**: Parties seeking ex parte relief must make full and frank disclosure of all material facts, including facts unfavorable to their case.

6.2.2 **Material Non-Disclosure Consequences**:
   - Interdict must be set aside for material non-disclosure
   - Court would not have granted relief if properly informed
   - Amounts to abuse of ex parte procedure
   - May constitute fraud upon the Court
   - Justifies personal costs orders against Applicant

6.2.3 **This Court Would Not Have Granted the Interdict** if properly informed that:
   - Applicant created the problems through card cancellations
   - Documentation "gaps" were caused by Applicant's own actions
   - Respondents acted responsibly to protect business
   - No genuine urgency existed
   - Applicant breached his own fiduciary duties
   - Application was pretextual for settlement leverage

### 6.3 Relief Sought Based on Peter's Causation

6.3.1 **Primary Relief**:
   - Declare interdict void ab initio for material non-disclosure
   - Set aside interdict in its entirety
   - Dismiss Applicant's application with costs

6.3.2 **Consequential Relief**:
   - Declaratory order that Applicant breached fiduciary duties
   - Personal costs order against Applicant de bonis propriis
   - Interdict restraining Applicant from further vexatious litigation
   - Referral to appropriate authorities for investigation of misconduct

---

## 7. CONCLUSION

7.1 This analysis establishes that the Applicant systematically created the very problems he now complains about:
   - Card cancellations created documentation access problems
   - System lockouts prevented normal operations
   - Self-manufactured crisis used as pretext for interdict
   - Applicant's own fiduciary breaches harmed the companies

7.2 The pattern of conduct demonstrates:
   - **Premeditation**: Actions coordinated with strategic timing
   - **Bad Faith**: Manufacturing crisis for litigation advantage
   - **Hypocrisy**: Complaining about problems he created
   - **Breach of Duty**: Violating his own fiduciary responsibilities

7.3 The material non-disclosure of these facts in the ex parte application:
   - Renders the interdict void ab initio
   - Constitutes abuse of Court process
   - Justifies setting aside in entirety
   - Warrants personal costs orders against Applicant

7.4 **Peter's Causation is Central**: Any fair assessment of this case must recognize that the Applicant engineered a crisis, blamed the Respondents for problems he created, and obtained urgent relief through material non-disclosure of his own role in creating the alleged urgency.
