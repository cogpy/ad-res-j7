### Section 7.2: Accountant Concerns (PARA 7_12-7_13)

**Introduction**
The Applicant attempts to use routine inquiries from the company's accountant, Daniel Bantjies, as evidence of financial wrongdoing. This is a gross mischaracterization of a normal professional process. This section provides the proper context for the accountant's communications.

**Routine Tax Season Documentation Requests**
- The communications from Mr. Bantjies were standard, routine requests for documentation in preparation for the upcoming tax season.
- It is a normal part of the accounting and audit process for an accountant to request clarification and supporting documents for various transactions.

**Filtered Information from Rynette Farrar**
- At the time of these communications, Mr. Bantjies was receiving information that was being filtered and manipulated by Rynette Farrar, who was controlling the Applicant's email account.
- The Respondents were not always party to these communications and were not given a proper opportunity to provide the requested information directly to the accountant.

**Concerns Based on Incomplete Picture**
- Any concerns expressed by Mr. Bantjies were the direct result of the incomplete and misleading picture he was being given.
- The Applicant and his associate, Ms. Farrar, were creating an information vacuum and then citing the resulting questions as evidence of a problem.

**Normal Tax Preparation Workflow**
- The timeline of these communications, when viewed in the context of the tax preparation cycle, shows a normal workflow.
- The Applicant has cherry-picked routine professional correspondence and presented it out of context to create a false narrative of alarm.
