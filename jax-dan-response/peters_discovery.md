### Section 7.4: Peter's "Discovery" and Timing (PARA 8-8_3)

**Introduction**
The Applicant presents his allegations as a recent, shocking discovery, implying that he took immediate action upon learning of supposed wrongdoing. This narrative is a fabrication. The timing of his "discovery" is highly suspicious and appears to be strategically motivated rather than a genuine reaction to new information.

**Suspicious Timing Relative to Settlement Negotiations**
- The Applicant's "discovery" of these issues coincided precisely with a critical phase in settlement negotiations between the parties.
- This was not a coincidence. It was a calculated move to create leverage and pressure the Respondents into a more favorable settlement for the Applicant.

**Coordination Between Applicant's Actions and Settlement Leverage**
- There is a clear pattern of the Applicant raising new, inflammatory allegations whenever the settlement negotiations appeared to be progressing.
- This demonstrates that his primary goal was not to address legitimate business concerns, but to gain a tactical advantage in the settlement process.

**Allegations Known for Months But Raised Strategically**
- The core issues raised by the Applicant were known to him for months, if not years, prior to the filing of his affidavit.
- The fact that he chose to raise them at this specific moment, in the context of settlement negotiations, proves that his claims of a sudden "discovery" are false.

**Timeline Analysis Showing Pretext**
- A detailed timeline of events, provided in **Annexure JF10A**, shows the correlation between the Applicant's actions and the settlement negotiations.
- This timeline demonstrates that the interdict was not a response to an urgent crisis, but a premeditated legal maneuver designed to derail the settlement process and impose the Applicant's will on the company.
