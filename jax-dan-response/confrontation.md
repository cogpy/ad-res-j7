### Section 7.5: Confrontation (PARA 8.4)

**Introduction**
The Applicant portrays the "confrontation" as a reasonable and necessary step in addressing his concerns. He omits the menacing and coercive nature of his conduct, which is part of a broader pattern of intimidation and control.

**Applicant's Menacing and Coercive Conduct**
- The Applicant's conduct during the confrontation was not that of a concerned director seeking clarification. It was that of an aggressor seeking to intimidate and dominate.
- His tone was menacing, his language was coercive, and his physical presence was threatening.

**Witness Statements**
- Witness statements from individuals who were present during the confrontation are attached as **Annexure JF-WS1** and **Annexure JF-WS2**.
- These statements corroborate the Respondents' account of the Applicant's aggressive and unprofessional behavior.

**Pattern of Intimidation Tactics**
- This confrontation was not an isolated incident. It is part of a long-standing pattern of the Applicant using intimidation, verbal abuse, and other coercive tactics to get his way.
- This pattern of behavior is a key element of the toxic and dysfunctional environment that the Applicant has created within the company.

**Context of Control and Manipulation**
- The confrontation should not be viewed in isolation. It is another example of the Applicant's obsessive need for control and his willingness to use any means necessary to achieve it.
- This context is essential for the Court to understand the true nature of the Applicant's actions and motivations.
