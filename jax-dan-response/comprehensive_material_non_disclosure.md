# COMPREHENSIVE MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE SUMMARY
## Consolidated Evidence for Setting Aside Ex Parte Interdict
## Case No: 2025-137857

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document consolidates all evidence of material non-disclosure by Peter Andrew Faucitt in his ex parte interdict application dated August 13, 2025. The analysis demonstrates **eight categories of material non-disclosure**, each of which individually would be sufficient to set aside the interdict. Collectively, they establish a pattern of deliberate omission designed to mislead the court.

### Material Non-Disclosure Framework

**Legal Principle:** An applicant seeking ex parte relief owes a duty of *uberrima fides* (utmost good faith) to the court, requiring full and frank disclosure of all material facts, including those adverse to the application.

**Test for Materiality:** A fact is material if its disclosure might reasonably have affected the court's decision to grant the interdict.

### Eight Categories of Material Non-Disclosure

| # | Category | Impact on Court Decision | Legal Consequence |
|---|----------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Responsible Person Regulatory Crisis | Would have shown irreparable harm to respondents | **Interdict would be denied** |
| 2 | Settlement Agreement Timing | Would have shown lack of genuine urgency | **Interdict would be denied** |
| 3 | Peter's Causation of Alleged Misconduct | Would have shown Peter manufactured the crisis | **Interdict would be denied** |
| 4 | Disproportionate Harm (36:1 Ratio) | Would have shifted balance of convenience | **Interdict would be denied** |
| 5 | Historical Business Model | Would have shown alleged conduct was standard practice | **Interdict would be denied** |
| 6 | Investment Payout Timeline | Would have revealed strategic financial motive | **Interdict would be denied** |
| 7 | Director Loan Account Structure | Would have shown R500K was proper corporate decision | **Interdict would be denied** |
| 8 | Transfer of Control to Non-Director | Would have shown Peter's own improper governance | **Interdict would be denied** |

**Conclusion:** Any one of these non-disclosures is sufficient to set aside the interdict. Together, they demonstrate a systematic pattern of misleading the court.

## 1. RESPONSIBLE PERSON REGULATORY CRISIS

### 1.1 What Was Not Disclosed

**Critical Fact:** Jacqueline Faucitt is the legally designated **Responsible Person** under EU Regulation 1223/2009 and equivalent regulations in **37 international jurisdictions** for RegimA Worldwide Distribution's cosmetics operations.

**Legal Significance:**
- Non-delegable personal duty
- Must be physically available for regulatory inquiries
- Personal criminal liability for non-compliance
- Cannot be performed remotely or through delegation

### 1.2 Impact of the Interdict

**Immediate Consequences:**
1. Jax cannot access business systems needed to perform RP duties
2. Jax cannot respond to regulatory inquiries (daily occurrence)
3. Jax cannot authorize product safety documentation
4. Jax cannot sign regulatory submissions
5. Jax cannot perform market surveillance duties

**Regulatory Exposure:**
- Potential fines: Up to €1,000,000 per jurisdiction = R20,000,000
- Multiple jurisdictions: **R50,000,000+ total exposure**
- Product recalls: R10,000,000+ cost
- Market access loss: R20,000,000+ annual revenue
- **Criminal prosecution** of Jax personally

### 1.3 Why This Was Material

**Question for the Court:** If the court had known that granting the interdict would:
- Immediately place respondents in regulatory non-compliance across 37 jurisdictions
- Expose respondents to R50M+ in fines
- Create risk of criminal prosecution for Jax
- Potentially require product recalls affecting thousands of customers
- Cause irreparable harm vastly exceeding alleged R500K misconduct

**Answer:** The court would not have granted the interdict.

### 1.4 Peter's Duty to Disclose

**Peter knew or should have known:**
- Jax has been Responsible Person since company's international expansion
- This is documented in all regulatory filings (37 jurisdictions)
- Peter himself relied on this structure for business operations
- Interdict would prevent Jax from performing these duties

**Failure to disclose:**
- Not a mere oversight
- Central to court's assessment of harm
- Directly impacts balance of convenience
- **Material non-disclosure**

## 2. SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TIMING

### 2.1 What Was Not Disclosed

**Critical Fact:** Peter and Jax signed a comprehensive settlement agreement on or around **August 11, 2025** - just **2 days before** Peter filed the interdict application on August 13, 2025.

**Settlement Contents:**
- Resolution of all outstanding disputes
- Agreement on director roles and responsibilities
- Framework for ongoing business collaboration
- Peter appeared satisfied with arrangements

### 2.2 Impact on Urgency Claim

**Peter's Interdict Application Claims:**
- "Urgent" financial misconduct requiring immediate intervention
- "Irreparable harm" to business if interdict not granted
- "Imminent danger" from respondents' conduct

**Reality Demonstrated by Settlement:**
- Peter was satisfied enough to sign comprehensive settlement 2 days earlier
- No genuine urgency - matters had been resolved
- Settlement provides alternative remedy to interdict
- Interdict filed strategically, not urgently

### 2.3 Why This Was Material

**Question for the Court:** If the court had known that:
- Peter signed a settlement agreement 2 days before interdict application
- Settlement resolved the very issues Peter now claims are urgent
- Peter waited only 2 days before breaching spirit of settlement
- Peter had alternative remedy (settlement enforcement) instead of interdict

**Answer:** The court would have questioned Peter's good faith and denied the interdict for lack of genuine urgency.

### 2.4 Strategic Implications

**Timeline Analysis:**
- August 11: Settlement signed (parties appeared reconciled)
- August 13: Interdict application filed (2 days later)
- August 19: Ex parte interdict granted
- May 2026: Major investment payout due (9 months out)

**Inference:** Interdict is strategic positioning for financial control, not genuine response to misconduct.

## 3. PETER'S CAUSATION OF ALLEGED MISCONDUCT

### 3.1 What Was Not Disclosed

**Critical Fact:** The alleged "misconduct" (R500K payment and IT expense documentation gap) was directly caused by Peter's own deliberate actions.

#### Peter's Causative Actions

**June 7, 2025: Secret Card Cancellations**
- Peter unilaterally cancelled all RegimA Worldwide business cards
- No notice to other directors
- No explanation provided
- Created immediate payment processing crisis

**Impact:**
- Strategic Logistics account depleted to R864.45
- Daniel unable to pay ongoing business expenses
- Emergency 66% director vote required for R500K advance
- **Peter created the "misconduct" he now complains about**

**System Access Restrictions**
- Peter restricted Daniel and Jax's access to business systems
- Prevented access to documentation
- Created artificial "documentation gap"
- **Peter created the "unexplained expenses" he now complains about**

### 3.2 The R500K Payment - Full Context

**What Peter Claims:**
- "Unauthorized R500,000 gift to Daniel"
- "Unexplained payment"
- "Financial misconduct"

**What Peter Omitted:**
1. **Peter's card cancellations created the emergency**
   - Account balance: R864.45 on July 16
   - Business expenses needed immediate payment
   - No cards available due to Peter's June 7 cancellations

2. **Proper corporate decision**
   - 66% director vote (Jacqui & Daniel)
   - Emergency director loan advance (temporary)
   - Standard business practice for director loans
   - To be reconciled against director loan account

3. **Peter's own similar withdrawals**
   - Peter has made similar director loan withdrawals for years
   - Same informal structure Peter now condemns
   - Peter's hypocrisy in characterizing as "misconduct"

### 3.3 Why This Was Material

**Question for the Court:** If the court had known that:
- Peter's own actions (card cancellations) created the R500K emergency
- Payment was proper corporate response to crisis Peter manufactured
- Peter has engaged in identical practices he now condemns
- "Documentation gap" exists because Peter restricted system access

**Answer:** The court would have recognized that Peter cannot manufacture a crisis, restrict access to documentation, and then seek relief based on the crisis he created and the documentation gap he manufactured.

### 3.4 Legal Principle: Clean Hands

**Maxim:** "He who comes to equity must come with clean hands"

**Application:**
- Peter manufactured the crisis
- Peter restricted documentation access
- Peter now seeks relief based on crisis and gap he created
- **Peter's hands are not clean**

## 4. DISPROPORTIONATE HARM (36:1 RATIO)

### 4.1 What Was Not Disclosed

**Critical Fact:** The harm caused by the interdict is **at minimum 36 times greater** than the alleged misconduct.

**Quantified Harm Analysis:**

| Category | Amount (ZAR) |
|----------|--------------|
| Alleged misconduct (Peter's claim) | R500,000 |
| Revenue theft losses | R3,100,000+ |
| Family trust violations | R2,851,000+ |
| Financial flow crimes | R4,276,000+ |
| Business disruption | R5,000,000+ |
| **Subtotal (documented financial harm)** | **R15,227,000** |
| **Plus additional documented harm** | **R3,050,000** |
| **Total documented harm** | **R18,277,000** |
| **Regulatory exposure (potential)** | **R50,000,000+** |
| **Total including regulatory** | **R68,277,000+** |

**Harm Ratios:**
- Conservative (excluding regulatory): **36.6:1**
- Full (including regulatory): **136.5:1**

### 4.2 Impact on Balance of Convenience

**Legal Principle:** Courts must consider the balance of convenience - the relative hardship to parties if the interdict is granted or refused.

**Peter's Position:**
- Alleged harm: R500K (disputed)
- Nature: Historical, compensable through damages
- Remedy: Accounting and documentation can resolve

**Respondents' Position:**
- Actual harm: R18M+ (documented)
- Nature: Ongoing, irreparable
- No remedy: Cannot be compensated after the fact

**Balance of Convenience:** Overwhelmingly favors respondents (36:1 ratio)

### 4.3 Why This Was Material

**Question for the Court:** If the court had known that:
- Interdict would cause R18M+ harm to respondents
- Alleged misconduct is only R500K
- Harm ratio is 36:1 (or 136:1 including regulatory)
- Most harm flows from Peter's own actions

**Answer:** The court would have denied the interdict as grossly disproportionate and failing the balance of convenience test.

### 4.4 Irreparable Harm Analysis

**Respondents' Harm is Irreparable:**
- Regulatory violations occurring daily
- Criminal liability exposure mounting
- Business relationships deteriorating
- Reputational damage permanent
- Family harm irreversible

**Peter's Alleged Harm is Compensable:**
- R500K can be recovered through damages if proven
- IT expenses can be explained through accounting
- Documentation can be provided through discovery

**Reference:** jax-dan-response/quantified_harm_analysis.md

## 5. HISTORICAL BUSINESS MODEL

### 5.1 What Was Not Disclosed

**Critical Fact:** The business practices Peter now condemns as "misconduct" were the **established collaborative model** that Peter himself participated in and benefited from for many years.

#### Historical Practices

**Director Loan Accounts:**
- All three directors (Peter, Jacqui, Daniel) have director loan accounts
- Multi-million rand credit balances in accounts
- Informal withdrawals and deposits standard practice
- No formal authorization required historically
- Peter made similar withdrawals regularly

**Collaborative Decision-Making:**
- Informal consensus-based governance
- Directors acted in concert on business decisions
- Flexible approach to director compensation
- Cash flow management through director loans
- **Peter participated in and endorsed this model**

**IT Expense Management:**
- Daniel managed IT infrastructure as CIO
- Expenses approved through consensus
- International operations required significant IT spend
- Peter aware of and approved spending levels
- No formal documentation historically required

### 5.2 Peter's Sudden Characterization Shift

**Before Interdict Application:**
- Peter participated in informal director loan system
- Peter made similar withdrawals without formal authorization
- Peter approved IT spending through informal consensus
- Peter benefited from flexible governance model

**In Interdict Application:**
- Same practices now "unauthorized"
- Same withdrawals now "misconduct"
- Same IT spending now "unexplained"
- Same governance now "interference"

**Why the Shift?** Strategic positioning for control, not genuine concern about practices.

### 5.3 Why This Was Material

**Question for the Court:** If the court had known that:
- Practices Peter condemns were historical business model
- Peter participated in and benefited from same practices
- Peter's own withdrawals followed identical pattern
- No change in practices - only change in Peter's characterization

**Answer:** The court would have recognized that Peter cannot:
- Participate in business model for years
- Benefit from that model
- Suddenly characterize same practices as "misconduct"
- Seek interdict based on practices he engaged in

### 5.4 Legal Principle: Estoppel

**Doctrine:** A party cannot take advantage of their own inconsistent conduct.

**Application:**
- Peter participated in informal director loan system
- Peter cannot now claim same system is "misconduct"
- Peter is estopped from denying validity of practices he engaged in
- **Interdict based on estopped position should be set aside**

---

## 6. INVESTMENT PAYOUT TIMELINE

### 6.1 What Was Not Disclosed

**Critical Fact:** A major investment payout is due in **May 2026** (approximately 9 months from interdict date), and Peter's interdict appears strategically timed to position him for control before this financial event.

**Investment Details:**
- Significant investment maturing May 2026
- Substantial payout expected
- Control of business entities determines payout allocation
- Peter seeking control through interdict before payout

### 6.2 Strategic Timing Analysis

**Timeline:**
- May 2026: Investment payout due
- August 13, 2025: Interdict application (9 months before payout)
- August 11, 2025: Settlement signed (2 days before interdict)
- August 19, 2025: Ex parte interdict granted

**Strategic Inference:**
1. Peter signs settlement when no better option available
2. Peter realizes settlement doesn't give him control before payout
3. Peter files interdict 2 days later
4. Peter positions for control of entities before May 2026 payout
5. **Interdict is strategic financial positioning, not genuine remedy**

### 6.3 Why This Was Material

**Question for the Court:** If the court had known that:
- Major investment payout due 9 months after interdict
- Peter's interdict strategically timed to gain control before payout
- Peter signed settlement 2 days earlier (not genuine urgency)
- Interdict appears designed to position Peter financially

**Answer:** The court would have questioned Peter's true motives and recognized the interdict as strategic financial positioning rather than genuine response to misconduct.

### 6.4 Legal Principle: Improper Purpose

**Doctrine:** Interdicts must be sought for proper purpose, not to gain strategic advantage.

**Application:**
- Peter's timing suggests financial positioning motive
- Not genuine concern about R500K alleged misconduct
- Strategic control before major payout
- **Interdict sought for improper purpose should be set aside**

---

## 7. DIRECTOR LOAN ACCOUNT STRUCTURE

### 7.1 What Was Not Disclosed

**Critical Fact:** All three directors (Peter, Jacqui, Daniel) have **director loan accounts** with the companies, with credit balances running into the millions of rand. The R500K payment was a legitimate director loan advance, not a "gift."

#### Director Loan Account Structure

**Peter's Director Loan Account:**
- Credit balance: R3,500,000+ (approximate)
- Numerous withdrawals over years
- Informal authorization process
- No formal documentation for many withdrawals

**Jacqui's Director Loan Account:**
- Credit balance: R2,800,000+ (approximate)
- Regular deposits and withdrawals
- Flexible management
- Used for business expense coverage

**Daniel's Director Loan Account:**
- Credit balance: R2,200,000+ (approximate)
- Similar informal structure
- R500K payment was director loan advance
- To be reconciled against account

### 7.2 The R500K Payment - Proper Context

**What Peter Claims:**
- "R500,000 gift to Daniel"
- "Unauthorized payment"
- "Financial misconduct"

**What Peter Omitted:**
1. **Director loan account structure exists**
   - All directors have multi-million rand loan accounts
   - R500K was advance against Daniel's account
   - Standard practice in these companies

2. **Corporate decision properly made**
   - Strategic Logistics (Pty) Ltd made payment
   - 66% director vote (Jacqui & Daniel)
   - Emergency situation (account depleted to R864.45)
   - Temporary advance to be reconciled

3. **Peter's own similar practices**
   - Peter has taken similar advances
   - Peter's withdrawals often informal
   - Peter benefited from same structure
   - **Hypocrisy in condemning as "gift"**

### 7.3 Why This Was Material

**Question for the Court:** If the court had known that:
- R500K was director loan advance, not "gift"
- All directors have similar loan accounts
- Peter has made similar withdrawals
- Payment was proper corporate decision in emergency situation

**Answer:** The court would have recognized that the R500K payment was not misconduct but standard business practice in these companies, and Peter's characterization as a "gift" is misleading.

### 7.4 Supporting Evidence

**Documentary Evidence:**
- Director loan account statements (JF-DLA1, JF-DLA2, JF-DLA3)
- Strategic Logistics bank statement July 16, 2025 (JF-BS1)
- Director resolutions for loan advances
- Historical pattern of similar transactions

**Reference:** 1-CIVIL-RESPONSE/annexures/JF-STRATEGIC-LOGISTICS-ANALYSIS.md

## 8. TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO NON-DIRECTOR

### 8.1 What Was Not Disclosed

**Critical Fact:** While Peter complains about alleged "interference" by directors Jacqui and Daniel, Peter himself has transferred **unprecedented control** to **Ms. Rynette Farrar**, a non-director bookkeeper, in violation of proper corporate governance.

#### Rynette Farrar's Expanded Role

**Normal Bookkeeper Duties:**
- Process invoices and payments
- Maintain financial records
- Reconcile accounts
- Prepare basic financial reports

**Peter's Transfer of Control to Rynette:**
- Full access to all bank accounts
- Authority to make payments without director approval
- Control over financial reporting
- Access to confidential business information
- Effective control over business operations

**Corporate Governance Violation:**
- Directors are supposed to direct the companies
- Non-director bookkeeper should not have strategic control
- Peter's characterization of director oversight as "interference"
- **Peter has inverted proper governance structure**

### 8.2 Peter's Hypocrisy

**What Peter Claims:**
- Directors Jacqui and Daniel are "interfering"
- Their oversight is "unauthorized"
- Their involvement is "misconduct"

**What Peter Omitted:**
1. **Directors are supposed to direct**
   - Oversight is their legal duty
   - Peter's characterization of duty as "interference" is absurd
   - Jacqui and Daniel acting properly as directors

2. **Peter transferred control improperly**
   - Non-director bookkeeper has strategic control
   - Proper governance structure inverted
   - Peter's own actions violate corporate governance
   - **Peter complains about directors while empowering non-director**

3. **Peter restricting director access**
   - Peter cancelled directors' cards
   - Peter restricted system access
   - Peter excluded directors from information
   - **Peter manufactured the "interference" complaint**

### 8.3 Why This Was Material

**Question for the Court:** If the court had known that:
- Peter transferred control to non-director bookkeeper
- Peter characterizes director oversight as "interference"
- Peter has inverted proper corporate governance
- Directors' actions are their legal duty, not "misconduct"

**Answer:** The court would have recognized that Peter's complaints about "interference" are really complaints about directors performing their legal duties, and Peter's own actions (empowering non-director) violate proper governance.

### 8.4 Legal Principle: Directors' Duties

**Corporate Law:** Directors have duty to oversee and direct companies.

**Application:**
- Jacqui and Daniel are properly performing director duties
- Peter characterizing duty as "interference" is improper
- Peter's transfer of control to non-director violates governance principles
- **Interdict based on directors performing their duties should be set aside**

---

## 9. CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF NON-DISCLOSURES

### 9.1 Not Mere Oversights

**Pattern of Omissions:**
1. Each non-disclosure concerns central fact
2. Each non-disclosure would affect court's decision
3. Together, they demonstrate systematic misleading
4. **Not accidental - appears deliberate**

### 9.2 Impact on Court's Decision

**If Court Had Known All Facts:**

| Disclosed Fact | Impact on Decision |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Responsible Person crisis | Immediate irreparable harm to respondents → Deny interdict |
| Settlement timing | No genuine urgency → Deny interdict |
| Peter's causation | Applicant manufactured crisis → Deny interdict |
| 36:1 harm ratio | Grossly disproportionate → Deny interdict |
| Historical business model | Alleged "misconduct" was standard practice → Deny interdict |
| Investment payout timing | Strategic positioning, not genuine remedy → Deny interdict |
| Director loan structure | R500K was proper advance, not "gift" → Deny interdict |
| Non-director control | Peter's own governance violations → Deny interdict |

**Conclusion:** With full disclosure, interdict would not have been granted.

### 9.3 Legal Standard for Material Non-Disclosure

**Test:** Would disclosure of the omitted fact have affected the court's decision?

**Application to Each Category:**
1. ✅ Responsible Person crisis - YES, would affect decision
2. ✅ Settlement timing - YES, would affect decision
3. ✅ Peter's causation - YES, would affect decision
4. ✅ 36:1 harm ratio - YES, would affect decision
5. ✅ Historical business model - YES, would affect decision
6. ✅ Investment payout timing - YES, would affect decision
7. ✅ Director loan structure - YES, would affect decision
8. ✅ Non-director control - YES, would affect decision

**All eight categories are material.**

2. ✅ Settlement agreement timing (2 days before interdict)
3. ✅ Peter's causation of alleged misconduct
4. ✅ Disproportionate harm (36:1 ratio)
5. ✅ Historical business model (Peter participated)
6. ✅ Investment payout timeline (strategic positioning)
7. ✅ Director loan account structure (not a "gift")
8. ✅ Transfer of control to non-director (Peter's violation)

### 12.2 Legal Consequences

**Each Category Individually:**
- Sufficient to set aside interdict
- Material to court's decision
- Adverse to Peter's application
- Should have been disclosed

**Collectively:**
- Demonstrate systematic misleading of court
- Pattern suggests deliberate omission
- Fundamental violation of duty of utmost good faith
- **Interdict must be set aside**

### 12.3 Final Assessment

**The interdict was obtained through:**
1. ❌ Material non-disclosure (eight categories)
2. ❌ Misleading characterizations (multiple instances)
3. ❌ Violation of duty of utmost good faith
4. ❌ Improper purpose (strategic positioning)

**The interdict causes:**
1. ❌ Disproportionate harm (36:1 ratio)
2. ❌ Irreparable harm to respondents
3. ❌ Regulatory crisis (R50M+ exposure)
4. ❌ Business destruction

**The interdict should be:**
1. ✅ Set aside immediately
2. ✅ Costs awarded on punitive scale
3. ✅ Damages awarded for harm caused
4. ✅ Application dismissed with costs

### 12.4 Declaratory Statement

**We respectfully submit that:**

The ex parte interdict obtained by Peter Andrew Faucitt on August 19, 2025, was procured through systematic material non-disclosure of facts central to the court's decision. Had the court been aware of:

- Jax's Responsible Person duties across 37 jurisdictions
- The settlement signed 2 days before the interdict application
- Peter's own causation of the alleged misconduct
- The 36:1 harm ratio demonstrating gross disproportionality
- The historical business practices Peter participated in and now condemns
- The strategic timing relative to a major investment payout
- The proper corporate nature of the R500K director loan advance
- Peter's own transfer of control to a non-director bookkeeper

...the court would not have granted the interdict.

The interdict must be set aside.

*This comprehensive analysis establishes systematic material non-disclosure across eight critical categories, each sufficient to set aside the interdict. The interdict must be set aside immediately.*

**Prepared for:** Case 2025-137857  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Document Code:** STRAT-007
