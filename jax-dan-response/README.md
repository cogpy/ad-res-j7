## Key Evidence Documents

### **üî• CRITICAL: Responsible Person Regulatory Crisis Section**
**Location**: `evidence-attachments/RESPONSIBLE_PERSON_REGULATORY_CRISIS_SECTION.md`

**‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY 1 (MUST-DO PHASE 1) - This is the most significant material non-disclosure in Peter's founding affidavit.**

This critical section addresses the Applicant's failure to disclose that Jacqueline Faucitt holds the legally designated Responsible Person position under EU Regulation 1223/2009 for cosmetic products in **37 international jurisdictions**. This material non-disclosure may alone justify setting aside the interdict.

**Key Components:**
1. **Legal Framework** - EU Regulation 1223/2009 requirements across 37 jurisdictions
2. **Non-Delegable Duties** - Personal legal liability and system access requirements
3. **Immediate Crisis** - How interdict prevents fulfillment of regulatory obligations
4. **Regulatory Consequences** - Potential penalties of R50M+ and business destruction
5. **Material Non-Disclosure** - Evidence of Applicant's knowledge and failure to disclose

**Critical Impact:**
- Creates immediate regulatory compliance crisis across 37 jurisdictions
- Exposes business to penalties of ‚Ç¨10,000-‚Ç¨1,000,000 per jurisdiction per violation
- Prevents response to regulatory inquiries within statutory timeframes (24-48 hours)
- Blocks ability to implement safety recalls or corrective actions
- May constitute fraud upon the Court through systematic material non-disclosure

**Evidence Requirements:**
- JF-RP1: Responsible Person designation documentation (37 jurisdictions)
- JF-RP2: Regulatory risk analysis and penalty assessment
- JF-RP3: System access requirements for compliance
- JF-RP4: Evidence of immediate consequences post-interdict

### Dan's Technical Infrastructure Affidavit
**Location**: `evidence-attachments/Dan_Technical_Infrastructure_Affidavit.md`

This comprehensive technical affidavit from Daniel Faucitt (CIO) addresses Peter Faucitt's allegations of "unexplained IT expenses" by providing:

1. **IT Infrastructure Requirements** - Detailed technical architecture including:
   - E-commerce platform (Shopify Plus multi-store, payment gateways, CDN)
   - International compliance systems (GDPR, PCI-DSS, product safety databases)
   - Business automation platform (order management, CRM, financial reporting)
   - Security and risk management (cybersecurity, encryption, backup, disaster recovery)

2. **System Access and Documentation** - Explaining how:
   - Peter's card cancellations in June 2025 disrupted documentation systems
   - Cloud storage, accounting software, and email services were suspended
   - Emergency actions with personal funds (R50,000-R75,000) restored critical services

3. **Business Continuity Measures** - Emergency response to Peter's unilateral actions

4. **Cost Justification with Industry Benchmarks** - Demonstrating IT spend of 6-10% of revenue is industry-standard for e-commerce (typically 5-10%, up to 12% for international operations)

5. **Impact of Interdict** - Documenting how the interdict creates immediate compliance violations (GDPR, PCI-DSS, Responsible Person duties, tax compliance) and threatens business destruction

This affidavit directly refutes the "unexplained IT expenses" allegations and demonstrates that Peter created the documentation problem he now complains about.

### Director Loan Practice Analysis
**Location**: `evidence-attachments/DIRECTOR_LOAN_PRACTICE_ANALYSIS.md`

This comprehensive analysis addresses Peter Faucitt's allegations regarding the R500,000 payment to Daniel Faucitt by demonstrating:

1. **Established Practice** - Documentation of decades-long informal director loan account transactions:
   - No formal board resolutions required for director loan transactions
   - All transactions properly recorded in Sage and bank statements
   - Practice accepted and utilized by all directors including Peter

2. **Peter's Participation** - Evidence that Peter himself used this identical practice:
   - Peter made similar withdrawals from his director loan account without board resolutions
   - Peter never objected to this informal practice when he benefited from it
   - Peter never characterized such transactions as "unauthorized" until strategically convenient

3. **Inconsistent Objection** - Demonstration of Peter's sudden and inconsistent position:
   - Comparative analysis showing Peter accepted practice for decades then suddenly objected
   - Timing reveals pretextual nature (objection 20 days after payment, coinciding with litigation)
   - Peter applies different standards to his own conduct versus others' identical conduct

4. **Material Non-Disclosure** - Facts omitted from ex parte application:
   - Peter's own participation in the informal model
   - Decades-long acceptance of the practice by all directors
   - Absence of any previous objections to this established practice

This analysis directly refutes the "unauthorized payment" allegation and demonstrates material non-disclosure through the Applicant's inconsistent application of standards.

- **`DIRECTOR_LOAN_PRACTICE_ANALYSIS.md`**: Comprehensive analysis addressing allegations regarding the R500,000 payment to Daniel Faucitt (PARA 7.7-7.8). This analysis provides:
