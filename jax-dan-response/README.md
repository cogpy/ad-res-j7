## Key Evidence Documents

### Dan's Technical Infrastructure Affidavit
**Location**: `evidence-attachments/Dan_Technical_Infrastructure_Affidavit.md`

This comprehensive technical affidavit from Daniel Faucitt (CIO) addresses Peter Faucitt's allegations of "unexplained IT expenses" by providing:

1. **IT Infrastructure Requirements** - Detailed technical architecture including:
   - E-commerce platform (Shopify Plus multi-store, payment gateways, CDN)
   - International compliance systems (GDPR, PCI-DSS, product safety databases)
   - Business automation platform (order management, CRM, financial reporting)
   - Security and risk management (cybersecurity, encryption, backup, disaster recovery)

2. **System Access and Documentation** - Explaining how:
   - Peter's card cancellations in June 2025 disrupted documentation systems
   - Cloud storage, accounting software, and email services were suspended
   - Emergency actions with personal funds (R50,000-R75,000) restored critical services

3. **Business Continuity Measures** - Emergency response to Peter's unilateral actions

4. **Cost Justification with Industry Benchmarks** - Demonstrating IT spend of 6-10% of revenue is industry-standard for e-commerce (typically 5-10%, up to 12% for international operations)

5. **Impact of Interdict** - Documenting how the interdict creates immediate compliance violations (GDPR, PCI-DSS, Responsible Person duties, tax compliance) and threatens business destruction

This affidavit directly refutes the "unexplained IT expenses" allegations and demonstrates that Peter created the documentation problem he now complains about.
