## Key Evidence Documents

### Dan's Technical Infrastructure Affidavit
**Location**: `evidence-attachments/Dan_Technical_Infrastructure_Affidavit.md`

This comprehensive technical affidavit from Daniel Faucitt (CIO) addresses Peter Faucitt's allegations of "unexplained IT expenses" by providing:

1. **IT Infrastructure Requirements** - Detailed technical architecture including:
   - E-commerce platform (Shopify Plus multi-store, payment gateways, CDN)
   - International compliance systems (GDPR, PCI-DSS, product safety databases)
   - Business automation platform (order management, CRM, financial reporting)
   - Security and risk management (cybersecurity, encryption, backup, disaster recovery)

2. **System Access and Documentation** - Explaining how:
   - Peter's card cancellations in June 2025 disrupted documentation systems
   - Cloud storage, accounting software, and email services were suspended
   - Emergency actions with personal funds (R50,000-R75,000) restored critical services

3. **Business Continuity Measures** - Emergency response to Peter's unilateral actions

4. **Cost Justification with Industry Benchmarks** - Demonstrating IT spend of 6-10% of revenue is industry-standard for e-commerce (typically 5-10%, up to 12% for international operations)

5. **Impact of Interdict** - Documenting how the interdict creates immediate compliance violations (GDPR, PCI-DSS, Responsible Person duties, tax compliance) and threatens business destruction

This affidavit directly refutes the "unexplained IT expenses" allegations and demonstrates that Peter created the documentation problem he now complains about.

### Director Loan Practice Analysis
**Location**: `evidence-attachments/DIRECTOR_LOAN_PRACTICE_ANALYSIS.md`

This comprehensive analysis addresses Peter Faucitt's allegations regarding the R500,000 payment to Daniel Faucitt by demonstrating:

1. **Established Practice** - Documentation of decades-long informal director loan account transactions:
   - No formal board resolutions required for director loan transactions
   - All transactions properly recorded in Sage and bank statements
   - Practice accepted and utilized by all directors including Peter

2. **Peter's Participation** - Evidence that Peter himself used this identical practice:
   - Peter made similar withdrawals from his director loan account without board resolutions
   - Peter never objected to this informal practice when he benefited from it
   - Peter never characterized such transactions as "unauthorized" until strategically convenient

3. **Inconsistent Objection** - Demonstration of Peter's sudden and inconsistent position:
   - Comparative analysis showing Peter accepted practice for decades then suddenly objected
   - Timing reveals pretextual nature (objection 20 days after payment, coinciding with litigation)
   - Peter applies different standards to his own conduct versus others' identical conduct

4. **Material Non-Disclosure** - Facts omitted from ex parte application:
   - Peter's own participation in the informal model
   - Decades-long acceptance of the practice by all directors
   - Absence of any previous objections to this established practice

This analysis directly refutes the "unauthorized payment" allegation and demonstrates material non-disclosure through the Applicant's inconsistent application of standards.
- **`evidence-attachments/`**: Evidence attached to the responding affidavit, including Dan's technical infrastructure affidavit.
- **`source-documents/`**: Source documents used in the response, including the main draft of the responding affidavit.
- **`financial-analysis/`**: Detailed financial analysis to refute the applicant's claims.

  - Detailed explanation of e-commerce platform architecture (Shopify Plus, payment gateways, CDN, security)
  - International compliance systems (GDPR, PCI-DSS, product safety databases) across 37 jurisdictions
  - Business automation platform (order management, inventory, CRM, financial reporting)
  - Security and risk management (cybersecurity, encryption, backup, disaster recovery)
  - Cost justification with industry benchmarks (e-commerce IT spend typically 5-10% of revenue)
  - Impact of Peter's card cancellations and the interdict on operational continuity and compliance
  - Total annual IT infrastructure costs breakdown: R4,860,000 - R7,340,000
  - Evidence that reported IT expenses (R6.7M for 2024) fall within expected range and represent only 5.2% of revenue

- **`DIRECTOR_LOAN_PRACTICE_ANALYSIS.md`**: Comprehensive analysis addressing allegations regarding the R500,000 payment to Daniel Faucitt (PARA 7.7-7.8). This analysis provides:
  - Documentation of decades-long established practice of informal director loan account transactions
  - Evidence of the Applicant's own participation in and benefit from this identical practice
  - Demonstration that the Applicant made similar withdrawals without board resolutions
  - Comparative analysis showing the Applicant's inconsistent application of standards
  - Timing analysis revealing the pretextual nature of the objection (20 days after payment, coinciding with litigation strategy)
  - Evidence that the payment followed established signatory authority and accounting procedures

  - Demonstration of material non-disclosure in ex parte application regarding settlement context
