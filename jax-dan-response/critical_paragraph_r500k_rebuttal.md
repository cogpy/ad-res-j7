### Section 6.2: Comprehensive Rebuttal to Allegations on R500K Payment (PARA 7.6, 7.7-7.8, 7.9-7.11)

**Introduction**
The Applicant's characterization of the R500K payment as a "theft" is a malicious and demonstrably false accusation. The payment was a legitimate transaction within the well-established and historically accepted financial practices of the company. This section provides the evidence to prove the legitimacy of the payment and expose the Applicant's hypocrisy.

**Director Loan Account Structure**
- For decades, the company has operated with a system of director loan accounts, a common practice in family-owned businesses.
- Directors frequently cover company expenses with personal funds, creating a credit balance in their loan accounts.
- Conversely, directors may draw funds from the company against these credit balances.
- This system is fully documented in the company's financial records.

**Historical Practice Over Decades**
- The practice of making payments to and from director loan accounts without formal board resolutions has been a consistent and accepted practice for over 20 years.
- The Applicant himself has participated in and benefited from this system numerous times.
- His sudden objection to this specific transaction, while ignoring the long history of identical transactions, is evidence of bad faith.

**Applicant's Own Similar Withdrawals**
- Attached as **Annexures JF-PA1 through JF-PA4** are examples of similar withdrawals made by the Applicant himself without board resolutions.
- This evidence demonstrates the hypocrisy of his allegations and establishes that the R500K payment was consistent with established company practice.

**Accounting Records and Proper Allocation**
- The R500K payment was properly recorded and allocated to the Second Respondent's director loan account.
- The company's accounting records, attached as **Annexure JF-DLA2**, show that a significant credit balance existed in the Second Respondent's favor at the time of the payment.
- The bank statement for the transaction, dated 16 July 2025, is attached as **Annexure JF-BS1**.

**Timing Demonstrates Pretext**
- The Applicant's decision to raise this issue in August 2025, weeks after the transaction and in the midst of settlement negotiations, is highly suspicious.
- This was not a sudden discovery, but a strategic decision to manufacture a crisis and create leverage.
- The timing, combined with the evidence of historical practice, proves that the Applicant's outrage is performative and not genuine.
