### Section 7.6: Urgency Claims (PARA 11-11_5)

**Introduction**
The Applicant's claim of urgency is the foundation of his ex parte application. However, this foundation is built on a series of falsehoods and material non-disclosures. There was no genuine urgency, and the Applicant has abused the court process by manufacturing a crisis for strategic gain.

**Systematic Refutation of Each Element of Urgency**
- The Applicant's claims of urgency are systematically refuted by the evidence.
- Each supposed "urgent" issue was either known to the Applicant for months, caused by the Applicant himself, or both.

**No Genuine Urgency Existed (Months-Long Delay)**
- The Applicant was aware of the issues he raises in his affidavit for at least two months before he approached the Court.
- If the situation was genuinely urgent, he would have acted immediately. His delay is fatal to his claim of urgency.

**Timing Was Strategic, Not Urgent**
- As established in the "Peter's Discovery" and "Settlement and Timing" sections, the timing of the application was dictated by the settlement negotiation schedule, not by any sudden, unforeseen event.
- The Applicant used the ex parte process as a tactical weapon, not as a shield against imminent harm.

**Material Non-Disclosures in Ex Parte Application**
- The Applicant failed to disclose numerous critical facts to the Court, including:
    - The existence of a recently signed settlement agreement.
    - The First Respondent's role as a Responsible Person.
    - His own role in causing the documentation challenges.
- These non-disclosures were designed to create a false impression of urgency.

**Evidence of Settlement Agreement**
- The settlement agreement, signed just eight days before the interdict was sought, is attached as **Annexure JF10**.
- This document is irrefutable proof that the Applicant's claims of a sudden crisis are false.
