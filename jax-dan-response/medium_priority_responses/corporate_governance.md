### Section 8.5: Corporate Governance Claims (PARA 10-10_4)

**Introduction**
The Applicant alleges various corporate governance failures. This section demonstrates that the companies were properly managed and that any governance issues were created by the Applicant's own disruptive conduct.

**Governance Framework**
RegimA companies operate as close corporations with established, informal governance practices that have proven effective over decades of successful operations.

**10.1 Board Resolution Claims**
- **Allegation:** Lack of formal board resolutions for certain decisions
- **Response:** Close Corporations Act permits informal decision-making when all members participate
- **Evidence:** Historical practice showing successful operations without rigid formalities
- **Counter-Allegation:** Applicant participated in and benefited from this informal model for years

**10.2 Financial Controls and Oversight**
- **Allegation:** Inadequate financial controls
- **Response:** Comprehensive financial management system documented in evidence
- **Evidence:** 
  - Sage accounting system with proper categorization and tracking
  - Regular financial reporting and reconciliation
  - External accountant oversight and tax compliance
  - SARS compliance and good standing documentation
- **Counter-Evidence:** Applicant's actions disrupted these very control systems

**10.3 Information Access and Transparency**
- **Allegation:** Restricted access to information
- **Response:** Information was freely available until Applicant restricted system access
- **Evidence:** 
  - Documentation of cooperation attempts (`JF8_COOPERATION_CORRESPONDENCE.md`)
  - Evidence of system lockouts imposed by Applicant
  - Timeline showing information was available before Applicant's disruptive actions
- **Cross-Reference:** See `peters_causation.md` for detailed analysis

**10.4 Decision-Making Authority and Processes**
- **Allegation:** Unauthorized decisions by Respondents
- **Response:** All decisions were within established authority and business necessity
- **Evidence:**
  - Established signatory authority for operational decisions
  - Business necessity for international compliance (Responsible Person role)
  - Emergency actions required due to Applicant's service disruptions
- **Cross-Reference:** See `responsible_person_regulatory_crisis.md` for non-delegable duties

**Governance Effectiveness Demonstration**
The proof of effective governance is in the results:
- **Revenue Growth:** From R2M to R19M demonstrating successful management
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Operations across 37 jurisdictions without violations
- **External Validation:** Good standing with SARS, banks, and regulatory authorities
- **Operational Continuity:** Business continued despite Applicant's disruptions

**Governance Breakdown Analysis**
Any governance issues arose directly from:
1. **Applicant's Unilateral Actions:** Card cancellations, system lockouts
2. **Information Manipulation:** Filtering through Rynette Farrar  
3. **Bad Faith Conduct:** Refusing to engage in resolution discussions
4. **Strategic Litigation:** Using court process to circumvent established practices

**Supporting Evidence**
- **JF-GOV1:** Historical governance documentation and practices
- **JF-GOV2:** Evidence of successful operations and compliance
- **JF-GOV3:** Documentation of Applicant's disruptive governance actions
- **JF-GOV4:** Comparative analysis with similar close corporation practices
