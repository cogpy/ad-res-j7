### Section 8.3: Investigation Claims (PARA 8_5-8_10)

**Introduction**
The Applicant details his supposed "investigation" into the company's finances. This was not a genuine investigation, but a pretext to justify his pre-determined course of action. This section exposes the flaws in his claims.

**Expose Flaws in "Investigation"**
- The Applicant's "investigation" was not independent, impartial, or comprehensive.
- It was conducted by individuals with a clear bias and a vested interest in a particular outcome.
- The "investigation" ignored exculpatory evidence and focused only on information that could be twisted to support the Applicant's narrative.

**Counter-Evidence**
- The Respondents have commissioned a truly independent forensic analysis of the company's finances. The results of this analysis are provided in the `jax-response/forensic-analysis/` directory and its subdirectories.
- This analysis, conducted by a qualified and impartial expert, refutes the Applicant's claims and demonstrates the integrity of the company's financial operations.

**Selected Supporting Annexures**
- **Annexure JF-FORENSIC-REPORT:** The full report from the independent forensic investigator.

**Cross-Reference to Comprehensive Analysis Documents**
- The flaws in the Applicant's "investigation" are further detailed in `Faucitt_Interdict_Analysis.md`.
