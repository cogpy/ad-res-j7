### Section 8.4: Settlement and Timing (PARA 9-9_5)

**Introduction**
The Applicant conveniently omits the fact that he was in the process of negotiating a settlement with the Respondents at the same time that he was preparing his ex parte application. This is a critical omission, as it reveals the true, strategic motivation behind his actions.

**Reveal True Motivation**
- The Applicant's true motivation was not to address an urgent crisis, but to gain leverage in the settlement negotiations.
- He used the threat of an ex parte interdict to pressure the Respondents into accepting his terms.

**Counter-Evidence**
- The settlement agreement, which was signed by the Applicant just eight days before he sought the interdict, is attached as **Annexure JF10**.
- This document is irrefutable proof that the Applicant was negotiating in bad faith and that his claims of urgency are false.

**Selected Supporting Annexures**
- **Annexure JF10A:** A timeline of the settlement negotiations, showing the correlation between the negotiations and the Applicant's actions.
