### Section 8.10: Confirmatory Affidavits (PARA 16-16_5)

**Introduction**
The Applicant relies on confirmatory affidavits to support his claims. This section challenges the credibility and reliability of these confirmatory affidavits, particularly those provided by parties with prior knowledge of matters they failed to disclose.

**Credibility Challenges**

**16.1 Daniel Bantjies Confirmatory Affidavit - Perjury**
- **Critical Issue:** Bantjies provided confirmatory affidavit while having prior knowledge of criminal matters
- **Timeline Evidence:** 
  - 10 June 2025: Bantjies informed of criminal matters
  - [Date]: Bantjies provides confirmatory affidavit without disclosing knowledge
  - 29 August 2025: ENS Africa acknowledges receipt with "Received, thanks Daniel"
- **Legal Consequence:** Perjury in confirmatory affidavit undermines entire foundation
- **Evidence:** `evidence-attachments/comprehensive_fraud_timeline_2017_2025.md`

**16.2 Information Filtering and Contamination**
- **Critical Issue:** Confirmatory affidavits based on filtered/manipulated information
- **Evidence Base:** All information provided to confirmatory affiants filtered through Rynette Farrar
- **Email Control Evidence:** Pete@regima.com controlled by Rynette, not Peter (Sage screenshots)
- **Reliability Impact:** Confirmatory affidavits cannot be reliable when based on manipulated information
- **Cross-Reference:** See `JF3A_EMAIL_FORENSICS_PATTERN_ANALYSIS.md`

**16.3 Incomplete Information Basis**
- **Issue:** Confirmatory affiants worked with incomplete picture created by Applicant's restrictions
- **Documentation:** Affiants did not have access to:
  - Complete financial records (disrupted by card cancellations)
  - Full context of director loan account history  
  - Understanding of technical infrastructure requirements
  - Knowledge of Responsible Person regulatory obligations
- **Evidence:** `JF8_COOPERATION_CORRESPONDENCE.md` showing restricted access

**16.4 Strategic Timing and Coordination**
- **Pattern:** Confirmatory affidavits obtained during strategic litigation period
- **Coordination Evidence:** 
  - Settlement negotiations timing
  - Investment payout timeline pressure
  - Strategic advantage seeking rather than truth-seeking
- **Cross-Reference:** See `settlement_and_timing.md` for strategic context

**16.5 Professional Misconduct Implications**
- **ENS Africa Conduct:** Knowledge of criminal matters suppressed from Court
- **Evidence:** "Received, thanks Daniel" acknowledgment followed by non-disclosure
- **Legal Consequence:** Fraud upon the Court through systematic suppression
- **Referral:** Legal Practice Council complaint warranted

**Reliability Assessment**
The confirmatory affidavits cannot be relied upon because they are:

1. **Contaminated by Perjury** - Bantjies knowingly provided false confirmatory affidavit
2. **Based on Manipulated Information** - All information filtered through compromised source
3. **Incomplete** - Missing critical context due to Applicant's access restrictions  
4. **Strategically Motivated** - Obtained for litigation advantage rather than truth
5. **Professionally Compromised** - Legal advisors suppressed material information

**Counter-Evidence**
- **JF-CONF1:** Timeline analysis showing confirmatory affidavit contamination
- **JF-CONF2:** Evidence of information manipulation affecting affidavit reliability
- **JF-CONF3:** Documentation of incomplete information basis
- **JF-CONF4:** Professional misconduct evidence and Legal Practice Council referral materials

**Legal Implications**
The contaminated confirmatory affidavits not only fail to support the Applicant's case but actively undermine it by demonstrating:
- Systematic manipulation of the litigation process
- Perjury in support of the application  
- Professional misconduct by legal advisors
- Bad faith conduct throughout the proceedings

**Cross-Reference Integration**
This confirmatory affidavit analysis integrates with and reinforces:
- Perjury arguments in preliminary matters
- Information manipulation timeline  
- Bad faith conduct patterns
- Fraud upon the Court allegations

**Relief Sought**
The contaminated nature of the confirmatory affidavits supports:
- Setting aside the interdict as based on false evidence
- Personal costs orders against those providing perjured affidavits
- Professional misconduct referrals to appropriate authorities
- Criminal referrals to DPP for perjury prosecution
