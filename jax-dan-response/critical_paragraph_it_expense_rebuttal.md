### Section 6.1: Comprehensive Rebuttal to Allegations on IT Expense Discrepancies (PARA 7.2-7.5)

**Introduction**
The Applicant's allegations regarding IT expenses are fundamentally flawed. They ignore the global nature of the business, the essential costs of running a modern e-commerce platform, and the Applicant's own role in creating documentation challenges. This section provides the necessary context and evidence to demonstrate that all IT expenditures are legitimate, necessary, and in line with industry standards.

**International Operations Context (37 Jurisdictions)**
- The business operates in 37 international jurisdictions, each with its own regulatory, compliance, and logistical requirements.
- This global footprint necessitates a sophisticated IT infrastructure to manage sales, distribution, customer data (in compliance with GDPR, POPIA, etc.), and multi-currency financial transactions.
- The Applicant's attempt to portray these costs as excessive ignores the fundamental requirements of a global e-commerce operation.

**Itemized Expense Breakdown**
- A detailed schedule of IT expenses, complete with invoices and contracts, is attached as **Annexure JF5**.
- Key expense categories include:
    - **Shopify Plus:** Enterprise-level e-commerce platform for high-volume, multi-national sales.
    - **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Cloud hosting for custom applications, databases, and backup storage.
    - **Microsoft 365:** Business-critical email, document management, and collaboration tools.
    - **Adobe Creative Cloud:** Essential for marketing and content creation.
    - **Sage Accounting:** Core financial management software.
    - **Payment Gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.):** Necessary for processing online payments in multiple currencies.

**Industry Benchmark Analysis**
- An analysis of comparable e-commerce businesses shows that the company's IT spend as a percentage of revenue is well within industry norms (typically 5-10%).
- This demonstrates that the expenditures are not extravagant but are a standard cost of doing business in the digital marketplace.

**Dan's Technical Infrastructure Affidavit**
- A supplementary affidavit from the Second Respondent (Daniel Faucitt), in his capacity as CIO, is attached as **Annexure JF-DAN-TECH**.
- This affidavit provides a detailed technical explanation of the IT architecture, justifying each major expense and explaining its critical role in business operations.

**Applicant's Causation of Documentation Gaps**
- As detailed in the "Peter's Causation" section, the Applicant's unilateral cancellation of corporate credit cards in June 2025 directly caused the suspension of several cloud-based services, including the accounting system.
- This action, taken in bad faith, is the primary reason for any gaps in documentation. The Applicant is attempting to use a crisis of his own making as a weapon against the Respondents.
