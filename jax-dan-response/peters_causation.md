### Section: MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE - APPLICANT'S CAUSATION OF ALLEGED PROBLEMS

**Introduction**
The Applicant presents a narrative of discovering financial irregularities and implies that these issues arose from the Respondents' misconduct alone. However, the Applicant fails to disclose to the Court that his own unilateral and disruptive actions were the primary cause of the very documentation gaps and operational challenges he now complains of. This constitutes a material non-disclosure of his role in creating the crisis he uses to justify the ex parte interdict.

**5.1 Card Cancellations Created Documentation Gap**
- In June 2025, the Applicant, without board resolution or proper notification, unilaterally cancelled the corporate credit cards that were used to pay for numerous essential cloud-based services.
- These services included the company's accounting software (Sage), document management systems (Microsoft 365/SharePoint), and other critical operational platforms.
- The payment failures caused by these cancellations led to service suspensions and lockouts, directly preventing the Respondents from accessing the financial records and documentation the Applicant later demanded.

**5.2 System Lockouts Prevented Normal Operations**
- The Applicant's actions were not limited to financial disruption. He actively worked to lock the Respondents out of key administrative systems.
- This included changing passwords, altering permissions, and instructing third parties to deny access to the Respondents.
- These system lockouts paralyzed normal business operations and made it impossible to conduct routine financial management and reporting.

**5.3 Self-Created Crisis Used as Pretext**
- The Applicant first created a state of chaos by disrupting access to financial systems and documentation.
- He then used the resulting lack of complete, up-to-the-minute documentation as a pretext to allege financial mismanagement and justify his application for an interdict.
- This is a classic case of a self-created crisis, where the Applicant manufactured the conditions necessary to support his claims of urgency and wrongdoing.

**5.4 Applicant's Own Fiduciary Breaches**
- The Applicant's unilateral actions constitute a significant breach of his own fiduciary duties to the company.
- By intentionally disrupting business operations and preventing proper financial management, he acted against the best interests of the company he claims to be protecting.
- These actions were reckless, harmful, and undertaken in bad faith to manufacture a crisis for strategic advantage.
