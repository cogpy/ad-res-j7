#### Timeline Analysis Insights

1.  **Months-Long Delay Contradicts Urgency**
    -   Issues allegedly discovered in June 2025
    -   Interdict filed in August 2025
    -   No explanation for 2-month delay if genuinely urgent

2.  **Strategic Coordination**
    -   Settlement agreement signed 8 days before interdict
    -   Interdict provides leverage in settlement negotiations
    -   Timing suggests pretext rather than genuine concern

3.  **Peter Created Problems He Complains About**
    -   Card cancellations in June caused documentation access issues
    -   Then complains about lack of documentation in August
    -   Self-created crisis used as justification for interdict

4.  **Information Manipulation Timeline**
    -   Rynette controls Pete@regima.com since at least 20 June 2025
    -   All of Peter's "knowledge" filtered through Rynette
    -   Peter's affidavit claims direct email receipt = perjury

5.  **Confirmatory Affidavit Contamination**
    -   Bantjies knew of criminal matters by 10 June 2025
    -   Provided confirmatory affidavit anyway
    -   Knowledge + false affidavit = perjury
