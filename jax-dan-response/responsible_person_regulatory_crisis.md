### Section: MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE - RESPONSIBLE PERSON REGULATORY CRISIS

**Introduction**
The Applicant failed to disclose to this Honourable Court that the First Respondent, Jacqueline Faucitt, holds the legally designated position of Responsible Person under EU Regulation 1223/2009 for cosmetic products distributed in 37 international jurisdictions. This material non-disclosure renders the ex parte interdict void ab initio, as the Court was deprived of critical information regarding the immediate regulatory crisis created by the interdict.

**Legal Framework**
Under EU Regulation 1223/2009 and equivalent regulations in 37 jurisdictions where RegimA operates, a Responsible Person must be designated for all cosmetic products placed on the market. The Responsible Person has personal legal liability for:
- Product safety and compliance with all applicable regulations
- Maintaining product information files (PIFs) for all products
- Ensuring proper labeling and packaging compliance
- Responding to regulatory inquiries and market surveillance
- Implementing corrective actions and product recalls if necessary
- Maintaining continuous market access authorization

**Non-Delegable Duties**
The Responsible Person role cannot be delegated or transferred without formal regulatory filings in each jurisdiction. The duties require:
- Continuous access to product databases and compliance systems
- Ability to respond to regulatory inquiries within statutory timeframes (often 24-48 hours)
- Authority to implement corrective actions immediately
- Access to financial systems to manage compliance costs and potential recalls

**Immediate Crisis Created by Interdict**
The interdict granted on 19 August 2025 prohibits the First Respondent from accessing the very systems required to fulfill her non-delegable Responsible Person duties:
- Product information databases
- Compliance documentation systems
- Regulatory correspondence and filing systems
- Financial systems for compliance management
- Communication systems for regulatory authorities

**Regulatory Consequences**
The inability to fulfill Responsible Person duties creates immediate and severe consequences:

1.  **Market Access Loss**: Products may be removed from sale in all 37 jurisdictions
2.  **Regulatory Penalties**: Fines ranging from €10,000 to €1,000,000 per jurisdiction per violation
3.  **Personal Liability**: First Respondent faces personal criminal and civil liability
4.  **Business Destruction**: Loss of international sales (representing [X%] of total revenue)
5.  **Reputational Harm**: Regulatory non-compliance damages brand reputation irreparably
6.  **Customer Harm**: Inability to respond to safety inquiries or implement recalls endangers consumers

**Material Non-Disclosure**
The Applicant knew or ought to have known of the First Respondent's Responsible Person role:
- This role has been held for [X years]
- It is documented in company records accessible to the Applicant
- It is a fundamental aspect of the international business operations
- The regulatory requirements are well-established and publicly available

The failure to disclose this critical information to the Court in the ex parte application constitutes:
- Material non-disclosure requiring setting aside of the interdict
- Possible fraud upon the Court
- Abuse of ex parte procedure
- Bad faith in seeking relief without full disclosure

**Relief Required**
The interdict must be immediately set aside to prevent:
- Irreparable regulatory harm
- Personal criminal liability for the First Respondent
- Business destruction
- Consumer safety risks
- International regulatory violations
