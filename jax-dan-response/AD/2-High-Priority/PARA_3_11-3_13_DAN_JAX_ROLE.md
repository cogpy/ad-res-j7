# AD Paragraph 3.11-3.13: Jax's Role in Companies - Daniel's Technical Perspective

- **Priority Rating:** 2 (High)
- **Topic:** Jax's Role in Companies
- **Peter's Claim:** Peter downplays the significance of Jax's role and her designation as the "Responsible Person."
- **Daniel's Response Strategy:** From a technical standpoint, explain the critical importance of Jax's role as the "Responsible Person" by detailing the system architecture and regulatory requirements that depend on her specific access and authorization.

## Key Points to Address

- [ ] **Responsible Person System Access:** Many of our core systems, particularly those related to compliance and regulatory reporting, are designed to require the "Responsible Person" for key operations.
- [ ] **IT Infrastructure Dependencies:** The IT infrastructure is built with the assumption of a designated "Responsible Person" to manage certain high-risk areas. This is a standard practice in our industry.
- [ ] **System Architecture:** The system architecture reflects the regulatory requirements of the 37 jurisdictions we operate in. Jax's role is a technical necessity for compliance.
- [ ] **Peter's Knowledge:** System logs and email correspondence can demonstrate that Peter was aware of the technical dependencies on Jax's role.

## Evidence Required

- **System Architecture Diagrams:** Visual representations of how the "Responsible Person" role is integrated into our systems.
- **Access Control Policies:** Documentation showing the specific permissions granted to the "Responsible Person."
- **Regulatory Compliance Documentation:** Technical specifications for meeting regulatory requirements in various jurisdictions.

## Daniel's Technical Perspective

From my perspective as CIO, the designation of Jacqueline Faucitt as the "Responsible Person" is not a mere title but a critical component of our technical and regulatory infrastructure. Our systems are designed to meet the stringent requirements of 37 different jurisdictions, and many of these jurisdictions mandate a designated individual with specific responsibilities and system access.

Here's how this is implemented in our IT infrastructure:

1.  **System Access:** Certain critical systems can only be accessed or modified by the user account associated with the "Responsible Person." This is a hard-coded security feature.
2.  **Compliance Workflows:** Our automated compliance and reporting workflows require authorization from the "Responsible Person" to proceed. This is to ensure accountability and to meet our legal obligations.
3.  **Data Integrity:** The integrity of our data is maintained through a series of checks and balances, many of which rely on the "Responsible Person" for final approval.

Peter's attempts to minimize Jax's role are misleading. He was fully aware of these technical constraints, as they were discussed in multiple meetings and are documented in our system architecture diagrams. His actions to undermine her role have put the company at significant regulatory risk.
