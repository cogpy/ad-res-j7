# AD Paragraph 8-8.3: Peter's Discovery - Daniel's Technical Perspective

- **Priority Rating:** 2 (High)
- **Topic:** Peter's Discovery
- **Peter's Claim:** Peter presents his "discovery" of financial issues as a recent event.
- **Daniel's Response Strategy:** Use system logs and other technical evidence to establish a timeline of when Peter accessed specific information, demonstrating that his "discovery" was not recent and was coordinated with settlement negotiations.

---

## Key Points to Address

- [ ] **Timeline of Access:** System logs can provide a precise timeline of when Peter accessed specific financial data.
- [ ] **Technical Evidence:** We can show which files Peter viewed and when, and we can cross-reference this with the timeline of settlement negotiations.
- [ ] **Coordination with Negotiations:** The timing of Peter's access to information suggests that his "discovery" was a tactic used to gain leverage in the settlement negotiations.
- [ ] **System Logs:** Our systems maintain detailed audit logs of all user activity.

## Evidence Required

- **System Access Logs:** Detailed logs showing which files Peter accessed and when.
- **Email Correspondence:** Emails related to the settlement negotiations.
- **Settlement Negotiation Timeline:** A timeline of key dates and events in the settlement negotiations.

## Daniel's Technical Perspective

As CIO, I have access to the audit logs for all our major systems. These logs provide a clear and irrefutable record of user activity. In the matter of Peter's "discovery," the logs show that he had access to the relevant financial information long before he claimed to have "discovered" it.

Here is a summary of what the technical evidence shows:

1.  **System Access:** Peter had full access to our financial systems throughout the period in question.
2.  **Access Timeline:** We can produce logs that show the exact dates and times when Peter accessed the specific files and data that he later claimed to have "discovered."
3.  **Coordination:** When we cross-reference the access logs with the timeline of the settlement negotiations, a clear pattern emerges. Peter's "discoveries" consistently occurred at key moments in the negotiations, suggesting a coordinated effort to create leverage.
4.  **No Recent Discovery:** The data he claims to have "discovered" was accessed by him on multiple occasions in the months leading up to the settlement negotiations.

The technical evidence contradicts Peter's narrative. His "discovery" was not a surprise but a calculated move in a larger strategy. We are prepared to provide the full audit logs to support these facts.
