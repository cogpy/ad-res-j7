## Daniel's Technical Perspective

As CIO, I am responsible for the systems that store and manage our company's documentation. I can confirm that on June 6, 2025, we provided the accountant with access to a comprehensive set of financial records.

The allegation that we failed to provide documentation is not only false, but it also ignores the fact that Peter's own actions created significant technical obstacles. Here's a summary of the events from a technical perspective:

1.  **Documentation Storage:** All our financial records are stored in a secure, cloud-based system that maintains a detailed access log.
2.  **Access Granted:** On June 6, 2025, the accountant was granted access to this system. We have logs to verify this.
3.  **System Disruption:** Shortly thereafter, Peter canceled the company credit cards that were used to pay for several of our cloud services. This resulted in a disruption of access to some of our systems.
4.  **Impact on Documentation Access:** While the primary documentation had already been provided, the system disruptions prevented us from accessing certain supplementary records that the accountant later requested.
5.  **Cooperation:** We were in constant communication with the accountant to resolve these issues and to provide alternative access to the data where possible.

Peter's actions were a clear attempt to obstruct our ability to cooperate with the accountant. We have a clear and verifiable audit trail to support these facts.
