## Daniel's Technical Perspective

I was present during the confrontation that Peter describes in paragraph 8.4 of his affidavit. His description of the events is incomplete and misleading.

From my perspective as CIO, the confrontation was a clear attempt by Peter to seize control of the company's IT infrastructure. Here's what happened:

1.  **System Access Demands:** Peter's primary focus during the confrontation was on gaining unrestricted access to all of our systems. He claimed that this was necessary for his "investigation."
2.  **Coercive Tactics:** When I explained that providing him with such access would be a violation of our security policies and regulatory obligations, he became aggressive and threatened legal action.
3.  **Technical Justifications:** I repeatedly tried to explain the technical reasons why his requests were unreasonable and dangerous, but he was not interested in a technical discussion. He was interested in control.
4.  **Impact on Operations:** The confrontation created a hostile and unproductive work environment. It also marked the beginning of a period of increased instability in our IT systems, as Peter began to take actions that were disruptive to our operations.

Peter's narrative of a calm and professional "confrontation" is a fiction. It was an act of intimidation and an attempt to gain control of the company's most critical assets.
