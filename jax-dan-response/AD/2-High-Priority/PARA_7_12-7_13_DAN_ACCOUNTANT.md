# AD PARAGRAPH 7.12 TO 7.13 - DANIEL FAUCITT'S ACCOUNTANT LIAISON PERSPECTIVE

## Priority: 2 - High-Priority

## Topic: Accountant Concerns - Dan's Direct Liaison and Documentation Provision

## Peter's Claim: External accountant (Daniel Bantjies) raised concerns about IT expenses and financial documentation

---

## Daniel Faucitt's Response - Direct Accountant Liaison

### My Role as Accountant Liaison

**Position**: CIO + Financial Systems Administrator + Primary Accountant Liaison

**Accountant Liaison Responsibilities**:
- Provide comprehensive financial data to external accountant (Daniel Bantjies)
- Extract and compile reports from Sage accounting system
- Respond to accountant's questions and documentation requests
- Coordinate tax return preparation and SARS filing
- Facilitate accountant access to systems and records
- Explain technical aspects of IT infrastructure costs

**Direct Relationship**: I am the primary point of contact between the business and Daniel Bantjies (external accountant). All accountant interactions go through me as the technical and financial systems expert.

## 1. ACCOUNTANT CONCERNS - CONTEXT AND TIMELINE

### A. Routine Tax Season Documentation Requests

**June 2025 Context**:
- ✅ Tax season (preparing 2024-2025 tax returns)
- ✅ Routine documentation requests from accountant
- ✅ Normal workflow: accountant requests → I compile → accountant reviews
- ✅ No unusual concerns initially—standard annual process

**Accountant's Questions (Mid-June 2025)**:
- Standard requests for IT expense documentation
- Typical inquiries about transaction categorization
- Routine questions about new vendors or services
- Normal tax season due diligence

**My Response**:
- ✅ Comprehensive reports compiled from Sage
- ✅ IT expense schedules with categorization
- ✅ Vendor lists with business purpose explanations
- ✅ Bank statements and transaction records
- ✅ All requested documentation provided promptly

---

### B. Peter's Interference and Information Manipulation

**Critical Timeline**:

**Mid-June 2025 (Before Card Cancellations)**:
- ✅ I provided comprehensive IT expense documentation to Daniel Bantjies
- ✅ Demonstrated full cooperation and transparency
- ✅ Accountant had all information needed for tax return preparation
- ✅ No concerns raised by accountant at this stage

**Immediately After Documentation Provision**:
- ❌ **Peter cancelled all business payment cards** (next day or within days)
- ❌ Created immediate service disruptions
- ❌ Sabotaged documentation systems I had just used
- ❌ Made it impossible to provide further documentation

**Late June - July 2025 (After Card Cancellations)**:
- ❌ Peter began feeding selective information to Rynette Farrar
- ❌ Rynette (Pete@regima.com controller) communicated with accountant
- ❌ Accountant received filtered information from Rynette, not directly from me
- ❌ Peter restricted my access to systems, preventing comprehensive responses
- ❌ Accountant's "concerns" emerged after information filtering through Rynette

**Peter's Pattern**:
1. Wait for me to provide documentation to accountant (cooperation)
2. Immediately sabotage systems (card cancellations)
3. Filter information through Rynette (manipulation)
4. Restrict my access (prevent counter-narrative)
5. Characterize accountant's filtered concerns as validation of wrongdoing

---

## 2. ACCOUNTANT'S INFORMATION SOURCE - RYNETTE FARRAR FILTER

### A. Email Control Evidence

**Critical Fact**: Rynette Farrar controlled pete@regima.com email account from at least 20 June 2025

**Evidence**:
- JF1: Sage screenshot (20 June 2025) showing pete@regima.com controlled by Rynette
- JF2: Sage screenshot (25 August 2025) confirming ongoing control
- JF3: ENS Africa correspondence (29 August 2025) acknowledging criminal matters

**Implication for Accountant Communications**:
- ❌ All accountant emails to pete@regima.com went to Rynette, not Peter
- ❌ Rynette could selectively share information with accountant
- ❌ Rynette could characterize IT expenses as "concerning" without technical context
- ❌ Accountant's "concerns" may be based on Rynette's filtered narrative, not objective analysis

---

### B. Accountant's Limited Technical Knowledge

**Daniel Bantjies' Expertise**:
- ✅ Expert accountant and tax professional
- ✅ Understands financial statements, tax compliance, SARS regulations
- ❌ Not IT infrastructure expert
- ❌ Not e-commerce technology specialist
- ❌ Not international compliance expert (GDPR, PCI-DSS)

**Information Dependency**:
- Accountant depends on explanations from business for IT expense context
- Cannot independently evaluate technical necessity of Shopify Plus, AWS, etc.
- Must rely on information provided about business operations
- Filtered information through Rynette = incomplete picture

**Example**:
- **Accountant sees**: R8.85M IT expenses
- **Rynette tells accountant**: "Unexplained, no invoices, possibly excessive"
- **Accountant's concern**: Based on Rynette's characterization, not independent analysis
- **What I would have told accountant**: "37-jurisdiction e-commerce infrastructure, industry-standard costs, comprehensive documentation available"

**The "Concerns"**: Are based on filtered information, not comprehensive review.

---

## 3. COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED (MID-JUNE 2025)

### A. What I Provided to Accountant

**IT Expense Documentation Package**:
1. **Sage Reports**:
   - Complete IT expense schedule from Sage
   - Transaction-by-transaction listing with dates, amounts, vendors
   - Category allocation (e-commerce platform, cloud hosting, software, etc.)
   - Bank reconciliation confirmation

2. **Vendor Information**:
   - List of all IT vendors with business purpose
   - Explanation of Shopify Plus (e-commerce platform)
   - Explanation of AWS (cloud infrastructure)
   - Explanation of Microsoft 365 (business email and productivity)
   - Explanation of Adobe (marketing and design)
   - Explanation of payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, Peach)

3. **Business Context**:
   - 37-jurisdiction international operations
   - Regulatory compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI-DSS)
   - E-commerce infrastructure necessity
   - Revenue scale (R12M-R19M) justifying IT investment

4. **Bank Statements**:
   - Supporting all Sage transactions
   - Proving payments to legitimate vendors
   - Matching Sage records

**Accountant's Response (Initially)**:
- ✅ Accepted documentation for tax return preparation
- ✅ No immediate red flags or concerns
- ✅ Standard tax season workflow

**What Changed**: Peter's interference and Rynette's filtered information.

---

### B. Peter's Sabotage Prevented Further Documentation

**Service Disruptions Caused by Card Cancellations**:
- ❌ AWS account suspended (storage with invoices inaccessible)
- ❌ Microsoft 365 suspended (email with invoices inaccessible)
- ❌ Vendor portal access disrupted (card payment failures)
- ❌ Cloud storage offline (backup systems down)

**Peter's System Lockouts**:
- ❌ Sage accounting access restricted (couldn't generate new reports)
- ❌ Bank portal access issues (couldn't download fresh statements)
- ❌ Email access limited (couldn't respond to accountant inquiries)

**Result**: 
- I provided comprehensive documentation in mid-June
- Peter immediately sabotaged systems preventing further cooperation
- Accountant's subsequent questions couldn't be answered due to Peter's obstruction
- Peter characterizes lack of further documentation as my failure, not his sabotage

---

## 4. ACCOUNTANT CONFIRMATION AFFIDAVIT - CONTAMINATION

### A. Daniel Bantjies' Confirmatory Affidavit

**Peter's Claim**: External accountant provided confirmatory affidavit supporting interdict

**Critical Timing Problem**:

**10 June 2025**: 
- Daniel Bantjies learned of criminal matters (email impersonation, identity theft)
- Email to ENS Africa dated 10 June 2025 discussing criminal matters
- Knowledge of fraud, perjury allegations, serious misconduct

**14 August 2025**:
- Peter files founding affidavit for ex parte interdict

**Date Unknown (but after 10 June)**:
- Daniel Bantjies provides confirmatory affidavit supporting Peter's application
- **Affidavit does not disclose his knowledge of criminal matters**
- Provides "independent" verification while concealing material information

**29 August 2025**:
- ENS Africa acknowledges receipt of 10 June email ("Received, thanks Daniel")
- Confirms Daniel Bantjies notified attorney of criminal matters
- Attorney and accountant both had knowledge before interdict

**This Is Perjury by Omission**:
- Accountant knew of serious criminal allegations (identity theft, email impersonation)
- Confirmatory affidavit implies neutral, objective assessment
- Failed to disclose knowledge of criminal conduct affecting business relationships
- Presented as independent third-party validation while concealing conflicts

---

### B. Accountant's Duty of Candour Violated

**Professional Obligations**:
- Accountants have duty of candour to courts
- Must disclose material information affecting objectivity
- Cannot provide "independent" confirmation while concealing conflicts
- Knowledge of criminal conduct = material information

**What Accountant Should Have Disclosed**:
1. "I have been informed of allegations of criminal conduct involving email impersonation and identity theft"
2. "My information may have been filtered through parties implicated in these allegations"
3. "I notified Applicant's attorneys of these matters on 10 June 2025"
4. "My concerns may be based on incomplete or manipulated information"

**What Accountant Actually Disclosed**: Nothing about criminal matters, filtered information, or compromised objectivity.

---

## 5. ROUTINE TAX SEASON INQUIRIES VS GENUINE CONCERNS

### A. Normal Tax Season Workflow

**Standard Process**:
1. **March-April**: Tax season begins, accountant requests documentation
2. **May-June**: Business provides financial records, schedules, explanations
3. **June-July**: Accountant reviews, asks follow-up questions
4. **July-August**: Tax returns prepared, filed with SARS
5. **Throughout**: Accountant may have routine questions about new expenses, vendors, categorization

**This Is Normal**:
- Accountants always have questions during tax season
- Routine inquiries about documentation don't indicate problems
- Due diligence questions are standard practice
- Follow-ups about new expenses or unfamiliar vendors are typical

---

### B. Peter's Mischaracterization

**Peter's Framing**:
- "Accountant raised concerns" (implies serious problems)
- "Major tax problems" (alarmist characterization)
- "Accountant supports interdict" (confirmatory affidavit)

**Reality**:
- Routine tax season documentation requests
- Standard questions about new IT vendors/expenses
- Questions likely based on filtered information from Rynette
- "Concerns" manufactured through information manipulation
- Confirmatory affidavit provided without disclosure of criminal conduct knowledge

**The Pattern**:
1. Routine accountant questions (normal tax season)
2. Peter restricts information flow (sabotage)
3. Rynette filters information to accountant (manipulation)
4. Accountant's filtered concerns (manufactured evidence)
5. Peter characterizes as independent validation (misleading Court)

## 7. COUNTER-NARRATIVE: ACCOUNTANT'S CONCERNS ARE MANUFACTURED

### The Real Story

**What Actually Happened**:

1. **Routine Tax Season** (April-June 2025):
   - Accountant requests documentation (standard)
   - I provide comprehensive information (cooperation)
   - Accountant begins review (normal workflow)

2. **Peter's Strategic Sabotage** (Mid-June 2025):
   - I provide documentation (cooperation evidence)
   - Peter immediately cancels cards (sabotage begins)
   - Service disruptions commence (documentation access destroyed)

3. **Information Filtering** (Late June-July 2025):
   - Rynette gains control of pete@regima.com (evidence: JF1, JF2)
   - Accountant communications filtered through Rynette (manipulation)
   - Rynette characterizes IT expenses as "unexplained" (false narrative)
   - Accountant's concerns based on filtered information (manufactured)

4. **Strategic Timing** (August 2025):
   - Settlement negotiations underway
   - Peter files ex parte interdict
   - "Accountant concerns" used as independent validation
   - Accountant provides confirmatory affidavit without disclosing criminal conduct knowledge (perjury by omission)

**Conclusion**: "Accountant concerns" are not independent third-party validation. They are manufactured through information filtering and manipulation, supported by an accountant who concealed his knowledge of criminal conduct.

## 8. MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURES BY PETER

### What Peter Failed to Disclose to Court

**Regarding Accountant Concerns**:
1. ❌ Accountant's questions were routine tax season inquiries, not red flags
2. ❌ I provided comprehensive documentation in mid-June (cooperation evidence)
3. ❌ Peter cancelled cards immediately after (sabotage timing)
4. ❌ Rynette filtered subsequent accountant communications (manipulation)
5. ❌ Accountant's information source compromised (pete@regima.com control)
6. ❌ Accountant knew of criminal matters since 10 June (conflicted)
7. ❌ Confirmatory affidavit omitted this knowledge (perjury by omission)
8. ❌ Peter's obstruction prevented further cooperation (manufactured problem)

**Impact**: Court relied on "accountant concerns" as independent validation without knowing:
- Concerns based on filtered information
- Accountant compromised by criminal conduct knowledge
- Respondent (me) cooperated fully until sabotaged
- Documentation problem created by Applicant, not Respondent

---

## 9. AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE - COOPERATION AND TRANSPARENCY

### A. Full Cooperation Record

**Evidence of My Cooperation**:
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation provided to accountant (mid-June)
- ✅ Prompt responses to all accountant questions (until sabotaged)
- ✅ Transparent explanations of business operations and IT needs
- ✅ Bank statements and Sage reports supporting all transactions
- ✅ Personal funds deployed to restore documentation access (R50K-R75K)

**Contrast with Peter's Obstruction**:
- ❌ Card cancellations preventing service access
- ❌ System lockouts restricting my ability to respond
- ❌ Information filtering through Rynette
- ❌ Blocking accountant's direct access to me

---

### B. External Accountant Can Testify

**Daniel Bantjies' Potential Testimony**:

**What Accountant Should Confirm**:
1. I provided comprehensive documentation in mid-June 2025
2. My initial responses were complete and cooperative
3. IT expense explanations were technically sound and business-justified
4. Service disruptions and access restrictions occurred after my cooperation
5. Subsequent information came filtered through Rynette, not directly from me

**What Accountant Must Disclose**:
1. Knowledge of criminal matters since 10 June 2025
2. Communication with ENS Africa about fraud allegations
3. Failure to disclose this in confirmatory affidavit
4. Compromised objectivity due to filtered information source

**Cross-Examination Opportunity**: Daniel Bantjies' testimony under oath with proper disclosure could significantly undermine Peter's case.

---

## 10. LEGAL ARGUMENTS - ACCOUNTANT LIAISON PERSPECTIVE

**1. Routine Tax Season Inquiries**: Accountant's questions were standard due diligence, not indication of genuine problems.

**2. Full Cooperation Evidence**: I provided comprehensive documentation and demonstrated transparency until Peter's sabotage.

**3. Information Filtering**: Accountant's "concerns" based on information filtered through Rynette (pete@regima.com controller), not objective analysis.

**4. Accountant Contamination**: Daniel Bantjies knew of criminal matters since 10 June, failed to disclose in confirmatory affidavit—perjury by omission.

**5. Peter's Sabotage**: Card cancellations and system restrictions prevented further cooperation, creating problem Peter now alleges.

**6. Material Non-Disclosures**: Peter concealed my cooperation, his obstruction, information filtering, and accountant's compromised objectivity.

**7. Manufactured Evidence**: "Accountant concerns" are strategic litigation tool, not independent validation.
