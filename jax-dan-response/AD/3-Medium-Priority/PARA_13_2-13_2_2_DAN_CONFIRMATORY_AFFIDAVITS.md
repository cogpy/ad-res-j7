## Daniel's Technical Perspective

In these paragraphs, Peter relies on confirmatory affidavits from other individuals. As CIO, I can provide a technical perspective on the claims made in these affidavits.

1.  **Technical Review:** I have reviewed the confirmatory affidavits from a technical standpoint. They contain a number of inaccuracies and misinterpretations of fact.
2.  **Lack of Knowledge:** The individuals providing these affidavits do not have a deep understanding of our systems and processes. Their statements are often based on incomplete or inaccurate information.
3.  **Refuting Claims with Data:** We can use our system logs and other technical data to refute many of the claims made in the affidavits. For example, if an affidavit claims that a certain person had access to a certain system, we can use our logs to verify or disprove that claim.
4.  **Expert Opinion:** We are prepared to provide an expert opinion on the technical aspects of the affidavits. This will show that the claims made in the affidavits are not supported by the technical evidence.

The confirmatory affidavits are not a reliable source of information. They are based on a misunderstanding of the technical facts. We are confident that we can use our technical evidence to show that the claims made in the affidavits are not credible.
