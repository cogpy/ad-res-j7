## Daniel's Technical Perspective

In this paragraph, Peter makes a number of additional financial claims. As CIO, I can explain how we can use our financial systems to verify or refute these claims.

1.  **Data-Driven Response:** Our response to these claims will be driven by the data from our financial systems. We will not be relying on opinions or interpretations, but on the hard facts as recorded in our systems.
2.  **System Reports:** We can generate a wide range of reports from our systems to provide a detailed and accurate view of our finances. These reports will show that Peter's claims are not supported by the data.
3.  **Verifiable Data:** The data in our systems is verifiable. We can provide a complete audit trail for all of our financial data, so that the court can be confident in its accuracy and integrity.
4.  **Expert Analysis:** We will provide an expert analysis of the financial data to explain what it means. This analysis will show that Peter's claims are based on a misunderstanding of the data.

We are confident that the data from our financial systems will show that Peter's additional financial claims are without merit. We are prepared to provide the court with all the necessary data and analysis to support our position.
