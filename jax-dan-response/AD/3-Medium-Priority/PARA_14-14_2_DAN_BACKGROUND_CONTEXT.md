## Daniel's Technical Perspective

In these paragraphs, Peter provides his version of the background and context of this dispute. As CIO, I can provide a technical perspective that will help to create a more accurate and complete picture.

1.  **Objective Timeline:** Our system logs provide an objective and verifiable timeline of many of the key events. This can help to correct the inaccuracies and omissions in Peter's narrative.
2.  **Digital Communications:** Our archives of digital communications provide a rich source of information about the context of the dispute. These records can show what was said, when it was said, and who said it.
3.  **System History:** The history of changes to our systems can also provide important context. For example, we can see when new systems were implemented, when old systems were retired, and when access rights were changed.
4.  **A Data-Driven Story:** By combining these different sources of technical data, we can create a data-driven narrative of the events that is more accurate and complete than the one that Peter has provided.

The technical evidence can help to provide a more objective and accurate understanding of the background and context of this dispute. We are prepared to provide the court with all the necessary data to support this.
