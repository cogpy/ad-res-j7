## Daniel's Technical Perspective

In this paragraph, Peter makes a number of claims about an "investigation" that he conducted into the company's finances. As CIO, I can provide a technical perspective on the limitations and inaccuracies of this "investigation."

1.  **Limited Access:** Peter's access to our financial systems was limited. He did not have the administrative privileges that would be necessary to conduct a full and proper investigation.
2.  **Misinterpretation of Data:** The data that Peter did access, he has clearly misinterpreted. For example, he has confused raw transaction data with finalized financial reports.
3.  **Incomplete Data:** Peter's "investigation" is based on a small and incomplete subset of our financial data. He has ignored the vast majority of the data that is available.
4.  **Lack of Expertise:** Peter does not have the technical expertise to be conducting a financial investigation. He does not understand our systems, our data, or our processes.

Peter's "investigation" is not a serious attempt to understand our finances. It is a superficial and misleading exercise that is designed to support his own narrative. We are prepared to provide a full and accurate accounting of our finances, based on the complete and accurate data from our systems.
