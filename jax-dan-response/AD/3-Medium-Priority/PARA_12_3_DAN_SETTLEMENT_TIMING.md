## Daniel's Technical Perspective

In this paragraph, Peter makes a number of claims about the settlement negotiations and their timing. As CIO, I can provide a technical perspective on these events, based on the digital records from our systems.

1.  **Timeline from Logs:** Our system logs provide a detailed and accurate timeline of many of the key events in this matter. For example, we can see when documents were accessed, when emails were sent, and when systems were changed.
2.  **Digital Communications:** We have a complete archive of all email and chat communications. These records can provide a great deal of insight into the settlement negotiations.
3.  **Coordination of Events:** By cross-referencing the various digital records, we can see how the settlement negotiations were coordinated with other events. For example, we can see how Peter's "discoveries" were timed to coincide with key moments in the negotiations.
4.  **Verifiable Integrity:** The integrity of our digital records can be verified through standard digital forensic techniques. We are confident that our records are a true and accurate representation of the events that occurred.

The technical evidence provides a clear and objective record of the settlement negotiations. This evidence will show that Peter's claims are not supported by the facts.
