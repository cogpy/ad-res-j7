## Daniel's Technical Perspective

We acknowledge the introductory paragraphs of Peter's affidavit. These paragraphs do not contain any technical claims that require a response from a technical perspective. We will therefore not be providing a substantive response to these paragraphs.

We cross-reference to Jax's response for a full and complete response to these paragraphs.
