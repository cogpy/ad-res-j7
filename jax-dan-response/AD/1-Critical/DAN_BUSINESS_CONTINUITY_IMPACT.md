## Key Impacts

- **System Disruptions:** Peter's cancellation of the company credit cards caused a major disruption to our cloud services. This resulted in downtime for a number of our key systems, including our e-commerce platform and our customer relationship management (CRM) system.
- **Data Loss:** The system disruptions caused by Peter's actions resulted in the loss of some data. We have been able to recover most of the lost data, but some of it is gone forever.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** The proposed interdict would make it impossible for us to meet our regulatory compliance obligations. This would put the company at risk of fines, sanctions, and the loss of our operating licenses.
- **Reputational Damage:** The disruptions to our business have caused significant reputational damage. Our customers have been inconvenienced, and our brand has been tarnished.

And we are facing the prospect of significant fines and sanctions if we are unable to meet our regulatory compliance obligations.

A full financial impact assessment is being conducted by our finance team.

## Conclusion

Peter's actions have had a devastating impact on our business continuity. He has disrupted our systems, caused the loss of data, put us at risk of regulatory non-compliance, and damaged our reputation. His request for an interdict is a further threat to our business. We are confident that the court will see that his actions are not in the best interests of the company.
