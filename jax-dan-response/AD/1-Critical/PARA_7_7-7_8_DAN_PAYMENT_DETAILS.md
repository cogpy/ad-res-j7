## Daniel's Technical Perspective

As the CIO, I can confirm that the R500K payment on July 16, 2025, was executed through our companyâ€™s standard financial processing system. My role involves ensuring the integrity and security of these systems.

The payment in question was authorized and processed in accordance with the following technical procedures:

1.  **Initiation:** The transaction was initiated by an authorized user with the appropriate permissions.
2.  **Authorization:** The payment required and received the necessary digital authorization, which is logged in our system. This authorization process includes multi-factor authentication to verify the user's identity.
3.  **Processing:** The payment was processed through our automated workflow, which ensures that all required steps are completed and documented.
4.  **Logging:** Every step of the process, from initiation to completion, is recorded in an immutable audit log. This log can be provided as evidence.

The systems in place are designed to prevent unauthorized transactions and to provide a clear and verifiable record of all financial activities. The R500K payment adhered to these established protocols.
