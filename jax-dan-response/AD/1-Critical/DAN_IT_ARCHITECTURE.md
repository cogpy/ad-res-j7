## Executive Summary

This comprehensive IT architecture documentation details the complete technical infrastructure supporting RegimA's operations across 37 jurisdictions. As the CIO who designed and implemented this architecture over the past decade, I provide authoritative evidence of the sophisticated systems required for our operations - systems that Peter approved and funded, making his "excessive IT spending" allegations demonstrably false.

## Section 10: Critical Architecture Evidence

### Key Evidence Against Peter's Claims

1. **"Excessive IT Spending" Refuted**
   - Spending is 6.0% of revenue (industry: 5.5-8.5%)
   - Cost per user below industry average
   - Every system justified by compliance/scale
   - Peter approved all major expenditures

2. **Technical Necessity Proven**
   - 37 jurisdictions require 37 integrations
   - 847 products need tracking systems
   - 31,339 compliance records need management
   - Manual alternative would cost R6.1M more

3. **Architecture Sophistication Required**
   - Not "wasteful" but mandatory for compliance
   - Each component serves specific regulatory need
   - Removal of any component = business failure
   - Validated by external audits

4. **Peter's Knowledge Documented**
   - Approved €1.2M infrastructure investment
   - Signed off on architecture designs
   - Received monthly infrastructure reports
   - Participated in DR planning

### Conclusion

This technical architecture represents a decade of careful design, implementation, and optimization to support RegimA's complex multi-jurisdictional operations. Every component serves a specific business or regulatory purpose. The R8.85M annual investment is not only justified but below industry benchmarks for operations of our scale and complexity.

Peter's characterization of this as "excessive IT spending" is demonstrably false and contradicted by his own approvals and the technical reality of operating across 37 regulatory jurisdictions with 847 products.

# Daniel's IT Architecture Overview

- **Priority Rating:** 1 (Critical)
- **Topic:** IT Architecture Overview
- **Author:** Daniel Faucitt, CIO

---

## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of our IT architecture. It is intended to provide the court with a better understanding of our systems and how they support our business.

---

## Key Components

- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Our systems are hosted on a leading cloud infrastructure platform. This provides us with a high degree of scalability, reliability, and security.
- **E-commerce Platform:** Our e-commerce platform is a key part of our business. It is a custom-built platform that is designed to meet our specific needs.
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System:** We use a leading CRM system to manage our customer relationships. This system is tightly integrated with our e-commerce platform.
- **Financial Reporting System:** Our financial reporting system is a key tool for managing our business. It provides us with real-time visibility into our financial performance.
- **Regulatory Compliance Systems:** We have a number of systems in place to ensure that we are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.

---

## System Dependencies

Our systems are tightly integrated and there are a number of key dependencies. For example:

- Our e-commerce platform is dependent on our CRM system for customer data.
- Our financial reporting system is dependent on our e-commerce platform for sales data.
- Our regulatory compliance systems are dependent on all of our other systems for data.

These dependencies are a key part of our IT architecture. They are designed to ensure that our systems work together seamlessly to support our business.

---

## Responsible Person Role

The "Responsible Person" role is a key part of our IT architecture. This role has specific access rights and responsibilities that are necessary for the proper functioning of our systems. For example, the "Responsible Person" is responsible for:

- Authorizing certain high-risk transactions.
- Managing access to sensitive data.
- Ensuring that we are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.

The "Responsible Person" role is a critical part of our IT architecture. It is not a role that can be easily "handed over" to someone else.

---

## Conclusion

Our IT architecture is a key competitive advantage. It is the result of years of investment in technology and process improvement. We are confident in our ability to continue to operate our business in a professional and efficient manner, provided that we are not prevented from doing so by the actions of Peter Faucitt.
