## Introduction

This document provides a high-level overview of our IT architecture. It is intended to provide the court with a better understanding of our systems and how they support our business.

## Key Components

- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Our systems are hosted on a leading cloud infrastructure platform. This provides us with a high degree of scalability, reliability, and security.
- **E-commerce Platform:** Our e-commerce platform is a key part of our business. It is a custom-built platform that is designed to meet our specific needs.
- **Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System:** We use a leading CRM system to manage our customer relationships. This system is tightly integrated with our e-commerce platform.
- **Financial Reporting System:** Our financial reporting system is a key tool for managing our business. It provides us with real-time visibility into our financial performance.
- **Regulatory Compliance Systems:** We have a number of systems in place to ensure that we are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.

## System Dependencies

Our systems are tightly integrated and there are a number of key dependencies. For example:

- Our e-commerce platform is dependent on our CRM system for customer data.
- Our financial reporting system is dependent on our e-commerce platform for sales data.
- Our regulatory compliance systems are dependent on all of our other systems for data.

These dependencies are a key part of our IT architecture. They are designed to ensure that our systems work together seamlessly to support our business.

## Responsible Person Role

The "Responsible Person" role is a key part of our IT architecture. This role has specific access rights and responsibilities that are necessary for the proper functioning of our systems. For example, the "Responsible Person" is responsible for:

- Authorizing certain high-risk transactions.
- Managing access to sensitive data.
- Ensuring that we are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.

The "Responsible Person" role is a critical part of our IT architecture. It is not a role that can be easily "handed over" to someone else.

## Conclusion

Our IT architecture is a key competitive advantage. It is the result of years of investment in technology and process improvement. We are confident in our ability to continue to operate our business in a professional and efficient manner, provided that we are not prevented from doing so by the actions of Peter Faucitt.
