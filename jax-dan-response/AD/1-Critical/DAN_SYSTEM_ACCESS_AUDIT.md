## Introduction

This document provides an audit of system access during the period in question. It is based on our system logs, which provide a complete and accurate record of all user activity.

## Key Findings

- **Peter's Elevated Access:** Peter was granted "auditor" level access to the financial reporting system at his own request. This gave him a high level of access to sensitive financial data.
- **Unauthorized Changes:** Peter used his elevated access to make unauthorized changes to the financial reporting system. These changes were a violation of our security policies and a breach of his fiduciary duties.
- **Access Restrictions:** After discovering Peter's unauthorized activities, we took steps to restrict his access to the system. This was a necessary measure to protect the integrity of our data and to prevent further damage to the business.
- **Peter's Obstruction:** Peter's cancellation of the company credit cards was a deliberate act of obstruction. It was designed to disrupt our business and to prevent us from accessing our own systems.
