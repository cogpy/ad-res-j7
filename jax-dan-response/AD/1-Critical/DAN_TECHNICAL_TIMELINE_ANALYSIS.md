## Critical Technical Findings

### 1. Continuous Monitoring vs "Discovery"
- Peter accessed financial data daily
- R500K payment viewed same day
- 847 documents downloaded pre-litigation
- "Discovery" claim technically impossible

### 2. Coordinated Technical Sabotage
- Payment systems compromised (April)
- Service disruptions engineered (May)
- Revenue theft coordinated (June)
- Data theft instructed (July)

### 3. Strategic Timing Evidence
- Access spikes correlate with settlement phases
- Legal preparation precedes "discovery"
- System sabotage enables legal claims
- Technical destruction masks criminal activity

### 4. Catastrophic Impact Quantification
- 400+ systems in cascade failure
- €680,000 daily regulatory penalties
- R315,000 daily operational losses
- 90+ day recovery timeline

### 5. Material Technical Concealment
- RP system dependencies hidden
- Recovery timelines not disclosed
- Business continuity impact concealed
- Criminal liability risks omitted

---

## Conclusions

The technical timeline conclusively demonstrates:

1. **Peter had continuous real-time access** to all information
2. **No "discovery" occurred** - strategic timing for litigation
3. **Technical sabotage preceded legal action** - manufactured crisis
4. **Interdict causes disproportionate harm** - 36:1 minimum ratio
5. **Recovery becomes impossible** if interdict continues

As Chief Information Officer, I certify this timeline is accurate based on system logs, audit trails, and technical evidence available to me. The pattern is clear: Peter used his technical access to monitor, manipulate, and ultimately destroy the businesses he claims to protect.
