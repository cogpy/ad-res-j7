### Section 7.3: Documentation Requests (PARA 7_14-7_15)

**Introduction**
The Applicant alleges that the Respondents failed to provide requested documentation, implying a deliberate effort to conceal information. This is a reversal of the truth. The Respondents have consistently attempted to cooperate, while the Applicant has actively obstructed access to the very systems that contain the requested documents.

**Detailed Log of Documentation Provided**
- A detailed log of all documentation provided to the Applicant and his representatives is attached as **Annexure JF8A**.
- This log, which includes email correspondence and file transfer records, demonstrates the Respondents' consistent and good-faith efforts to be transparent.

**Applicant Restricted Access to Systems**
- The Applicant's claim that the Respondents failed to provide documentation is made in bad faith, as he is the one who has restricted their access to the systems where the documentation resides.
- As established in the "Peter's Causation" section, the Applicant's cancellation of corporate credit cards and his active efforts to lock the Respondents out of administrative systems are the direct cause of any delays or difficulties in providing documentation.

**Requests Made in Bad Faith**
- The Applicant's requests for documentation are a sham. He is demanding that the Respondents produce documents that he himself has made inaccessible.
- This is a classic example of a "catch-22" situation, designed to create the illusion of non-cooperation.

**Evidence of Cooperation Attempts**
- Further evidence of the Respondents' attempts to cooperate is included in **Annexures JF8B, JF8C, and JF8D**, which show:
    - Email chains demonstrating cooperation attempts.
    - Evidence of the Applicant's refusal to engage.
    - Details of the system access restrictions imposed by the Applicant.
