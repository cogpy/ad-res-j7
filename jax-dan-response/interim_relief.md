### Section 7.7: Interim Relief Harm (PARA 13-13_1)

**Introduction**
The Applicant sought and obtained interim relief that is not only disproportionate to the issues raised but is actively harmful to the company he claims to be protecting. The relief granted has created a regulatory and operational crisis, and the Applicant's failure to disclose this risk to the Court is yet another material non-disclosure.

**Regulatory Crisis Created by Interdict**
- As detailed in the "Responsible Person" section, the interdict has made it impossible for the First Respondent to fulfill her statutory duties.
- This has exposed the company to over R50 million in potential fines and the complete loss of access to 37 international markets.

**Applicant's Own Conduct Caused the Problems**
- The Applicant is complaining about a fire that he started. He created the documentation and operational challenges through his own disruptive actions, and now he seeks to use those challenges as a basis for relief.

**Disproportionate and Harmful Relief**
- The relief granted is wildly disproportionate to the R500,000 payment that is the central focus of the Applicant's financial allegations.
- The Court was not informed that the relief sought would cause harm to the company that is orders of magnitude greater than the supposed harm the Applicant was trying to prevent.

**Quantified Business Harm**
- The harm to the business from the interdict is quantifiable and significant:
    - **36:1 Harm Ratio:** The R18M+ in quantifiable losses and potential penalties dwarfs the R500K payment at the heart of the dispute.
    - **Operational Paralysis:** The company is unable to conduct its normal business operations, leading to lost sales and customer dissatisfaction.
    - **Reputational Damage:** The regulatory non-compliance caused by the interdict is causing long-term damage to the company's brand and reputation.
