### Section 7.1: Respondent Roles and Responsibilities (PARA 3-3.10 & PARA 3_11-3_13)

**Introduction**
The Applicant's founding affidavit minimizes the First Respondent's role and responsibilities, a strategic omission designed to mislead the Court. This section clarifies the distinct and critical roles of both Respondents, with a particular focus on the First Respondent's statutory duties as a Responsible Person.

**Critical Addition: First Respondent as Responsible Person**
- The First Respondent, Jacqueline Faucitt, is the legally designated **Responsible Person** for the company's products in 37 international jurisdictions, under EU Regulation 1223/2009 and other equivalent regulations.
- This is a statutory role with significant personal liability for product safety and compliance.
- This role is non-delegable and requires continuous, unrestricted access to the company's compliance, financial, and operational systems.

**Immediate Compliance Crisis Created by Interdict**
- The ex parte interdict, by blocking the First Respondent's access to critical systems, has created an immediate and ongoing compliance crisis.
- The First Respondent is unable to fulfill her statutory duties, placing the company at risk of significant financial penalties, market access loss, and reputational damage.
- The Applicant's failure to disclose this to the Court is a material non-disclosure that renders the interdict void ab initio.

**Quantifiable Penalties and Market Loss**
- The potential financial penalties for non-compliance range from €10,000 to €1,000,000 per violation, per jurisdiction.
- The loss of market access in 37 jurisdictions would result in a catastrophic loss of revenue.

**Role Differentiation**
- **Jacqueline Faucitt (First Respondent):** CEO of RegimA Skin Treatments and the designated Responsible Person. Her focus is on brand management, product development, and international compliance.
- **Daniel Faucitt (Second Respondent):** CIO of RegimA Worldwide Distribution. His focus is on the company's technical infrastructure, e-commerce platform, and business automation.

This clear differentiation is essential to counter the Applicant's attempts to conflate their roles and misrepresent their respective responsibilities.
