# Simple Workflow Test - Task Completion Report

## Task Overview

**Task:** Test basic workflow functionality with this simple task  
**Source:** `todo/simple-workflow-test.md`, Line 5  
**Section:** Must-Do (Critical Priority)  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

## What Was Done

### 1. Test Implementation
Created a comprehensive test suite to validate basic workflow functionality:
- **Test File:** `tests/simple-workflow-test.js`
- **Test Cases:** 7 independent tests covering all aspects of the workflow
- **Test Results:** 9/9 assertions passed (100% success rate)

### 2. Test Coverage

The test validates:
1. ✅ Todo file exists (`simple-workflow-test.md`)
2. ✅ File has proper content structure
3. ✅ Task detection logic works correctly
4. ✅ Priority detection (Must-Do = Critical Priority)
5. ✅ Task format recognition (numbered lists)
6. ✅ Action word detection in tasks
7. ✅ Workflow file exists and is accessible

### 3. Documentation
Created comprehensive documentation:
- **Test Results:** `tests/SIMPLE_WORKFLOW_TEST_RESULTS.md`
- **Completion Report:** This document
- **Package Script:** Added `npm run test:simple` command

### 4. Integration
- ✅ Added test script to `package.json`
- ✅ Test passes independently
- ✅ Test doesn't break existing test suite (still 92% pass rate)
- ✅ Test is reusable and maintainable

## Evidence of Workflow Success

### 1. Issue Creation
This GitHub issue was automatically created by the workflow, proving that:
- ✅ Workflow parses markdown files in `todo/` folder
- ✅ Workflow detects tasks in priority sections
- ✅ Workflow creates issues with correct metadata
- ✅ Workflow assigns appropriate labels

### 2. Test Execution Output
```bash
$ npm run test:simple
