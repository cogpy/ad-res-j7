### 2. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

#### 2.1 The True Nature of This Dispute

2.1.1 This matter concerns the Applicant's attempt to appropriate business operations that were built and managed independently by the Second Respondent (Daniel James Faucitt) and his late business partner, **Kayla Pretorius** (deceased).

2.1.2 The Applicant seeks to rewrite history by claiming that he always controlled these businesses, when the documentary evidence proves the opposite.

2.1.3 The Applicant's claims are contradicted by a critical piece of evidence: the **Shopify Plus onboarding email dated 26 July 2017** ("the Shopify Email"), which serves as a "forensic time capsule" proving Daniel and Kayla's independent business operations.

#### 2.2 The Applicant's False Narrative

2.2.1 The Applicant claims that:
- Daniel and Kayla never operated independent businesses;
- All business operations were controlled by "head office" (meaning the Applicant);
- Daniel is "delusional" about his role in the businesses;
- I (Jacqueline) suffer from "dementia" and my testimony is unreliable.

2.2.2 Each of these claims is demonstrably false and contradicted by documentary evidence.

#### 2.3 The Documentary Evidence

2.2.3 The evidence I present in this affidavit includes:
- **Irrefutable proof**: The Shopify Plus email (26 July 2017) - **Annexure JF1**

## PART B: BACKGROUND AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### 3. THE 2016 FORCED SEPARATION

#### 3.1 The Incident That Changed Everything

3.1.1 In **2016**, a critical incident occurred that fundamentally altered the business relationships within our family.

3.1.2 Following a business disagreement, the Applicant (Peter):
- Physically ejected Daniel and Kayla Pretorius from the office premises;
- Instructed staff to disregard any instructions from Daniel;
- Confiscated their equipment, including computers and laptops;
- Declared to them: **"You're on your own nowâ€”buy your own laptops, pay for your own office."**

3.1.3 I witnessed these events personally. The Applicant's actions were unambiguous: he was severing the business relationship with Daniel and Kayla.

3.1.4 This forced separation was not a temporary disagreement. It was a permanent rupture that required Daniel and Kayla to build completely independent business operations.

#### 3.2 The Independent Business Building Period (2016-2019)

3.2.1 Following the 2016 separation, Daniel and Kayla operated from Daniel's residential property.

3.2.2 They built e-commerce operations **completely independently** of the Applicant's entities.

3.2.3 During this period (2016-2019), Daniel and Kayla:
- Incorporated **five independent companies**:
  - Unicorn Dynamics (Pty) Ltd (2016/307425/07) - incorporated 2016
  - ReZonance (Pty) Ltd (2017/081396/07) - incorporated 2017
  - RegimA Zone (Pty) Ltd (2017/110437/07) - incorporated 2017
  - RegimA Zone Academy (Pty) Ltd (2017/113134/07) - incorporated 2017
  - RegimA Zone Impact (Pty) Ltd (2017/109415/07) - incorporated 2017

3.2.4 They self-funded all operations, including:
- Equipment purchases (laptops, servers, networking equipment);
- Shopify platform subscriptions (as evidenced by the Shopify Email);
- QuickBooks accounting systems;
- Internet and utilities;
- Office supplies and furniture;
- Marketing and advertising expenses.

3.2.5 I personally witnessed this independent business building. I saw Daniel and Kayla working from Daniel's home, managing their own operations, and building their businesses without any involvement from the Applicant.

#### 3.3 My Role and Observations

3.3.1 Throughout this period, I maintained relationships with both my sons (Peter and Daniel).

3.3.2 I observed firsthand that:
- Daniel and Kayla were operating independently;
- They were managing their own client relationships;
- They were making their own business decisions;
- The Applicant had no involvement in their day-to-day operations.

3.3.3 The Applicant's current claims that he always controlled these operations are a complete fabrication designed to appropriate businesses he did not build.

---

### 4. THE SHOPIFY PLUS EMAIL: IRREFUTABLE PROOF

#### 4.1 The "Forensic Time Capsule"

4.1.1 The most critical piece of evidence in this matter is the **Shopify Plus onboarding email dated 26 July 2017**, attached as **Annexure JF1**.

4.1.2 This email is what I call a "**forensic time capsule**" - an unalterable historical record that definitively proves Daniel and Kayla's independent business operations.

4.1.3 The email cannot be disputed, altered, or explained away. It is contemporaneous documentary evidence from a third-party service provider (Shopify Inc.) that has no interest in this dispute.

#### 4.2 What the Shopify Email Proves

4.2.1 The Shopify Email demonstrates the following irrefutable facts:

**a) Kayla Pretorius was personally managing the Shopify Plus onboarding**
- She directly communicated with Richard Estabrooks (Shopify Launch Manager);
- She confirmed meeting times and handled all business correspondence;
- She used personal email addresses: kayp@rzo.io and kayla@regima.zone;
- She provided direct contact information: **011 615 29869** (her personal phone number).

**b) Daniel was directly involved in business operations**
- Daniel was CC'd on the email communications;
- This establishes his legitimate involvement from the beginning;
- His role was not peripheral - he was a key decision-maker.

**c) No "head office" involvement**
- There is **zero evidence** of any centralized control by the Applicant;
- All communications were direct between Kayla and Shopify;
- No intermediary or "head office" is mentioned anywhere in the correspondence.

**d) Independent business structure**
- The email shows Kayla representing **Unicorn Dynamics Pty Ltd**;
- This was one of the independent companies incorporated by Daniel and Kayla;
- The business was operating under its own identity, not as a subsidiary of the Applicant's entities.

#### 4.3 The Applicant's Claims Demolished

4.3.1 The Shopify Email completely demolishes the Applicant's central claims:

**Claim 1**: "Daniel and Kayla never operated independent businesses"
- **Refuted**: The email proves they were operating Shopify Plus accounts independently.

**Claim 2**: "All operations were controlled by head office"
- **Refuted**: No evidence of centralized control; Kayla managed the relationship directly.

**Claim 3**: "Daniel is delusional about his role"
- **Refuted**: Daniel was CC'd on business communications, proving his legitimate involvement.

**Claim 4**: "Jacqui has dementia and her testimony is unreliable"
- **Refuted**: My testimony aligns perfectly with the documentary evidence in the Shopify Email.

#### 4.4 The Phone Number: Direct Physical Evidence

4.4.1 The Shopify Email contains Kayla's phone number: **011 615 29869**.

4.4.2 This phone number is particularly significant because:
- It was Kayla's personal business line in 2017;
- After Kayla's death, this phone number was **appropriated by the Applicant or his associates**;
- The appropriation of this phone number constitutes **identity theft** and provides direct physical evidence of business hijacking.

4.4.3 The phone number transfer demonstrates the systematic appropriation of Daniel and Kayla's business operations following Kayla's death.

---

### 5. KAYLA PRETORIUS: THE BUSINESS PARTNER

#### 5.1 Kayla's Role

5.1.1 **Kayla Pretorius** was Daniel's business partner from 2016 until her untimely death.

5.1.2 Kayla was not merely an employee or assistant. She was a **co-founder** and **co-manager** of the independent businesses built after the 2016 separation.

5.1.3 The Shopify Email proves Kayla's central role:
- She was the primary contact for Shopify Plus onboarding;
- She managed client relationships directly;
- She made business decisions independently;
- She represented the company in external communications.

#### 5.2 Kayla's Death and the Subsequent Appropriation

5.2.1 Following Kayla's death, the Applicant and his associates systematically appropriated the businesses that Daniel and Kayla had built.

5.2.2 This appropriation included:
- Taking control of revenue streams;
- Appropriating phone numbers and contact information (as evidenced by the 011 615 29869 transfer);
- Destroying evidence of legitimate business operations (Shopify audit trail destruction on 22 May 2025);
- Rewriting history to claim the Applicant always controlled these operations.

5.2.3 The timing is significant: the appropriation occurred **after Kayla's death**, when she could no longer defend the truth about the business operations.

---

### 6. THE 2025 EVIDENCE DESTRUCTION

#### 6.1 The Shopify Audit Trail Destruction

6.1.1 On **22 May 2025**, exactly **seven (7) days** after I confronted the Applicant about missing funds, the Shopify audit trails were systematically destroyed.

6.1.2 This destruction was not accidental. It was a deliberate act designed to eliminate evidence that would prove Daniel and Kayla's legitimate business operations.

6.1.3 The destroyed records would have shown:
- The complete history of Shopify Plus account management;
- Kayla's role as the primary account manager;
- Daniel's involvement in business operations;
- The independent nature of the business structure.

#### 6.2 Consciousness of Guilt

6.2.1 The timing of the evidence destruction demonstrates **consciousness of guilt**.

6.2.2 The Applicant and his associates understood that the Shopify records contradicted their false "head office" narrative.

6.2.3 By destroying these records, they sought to eliminate proof of Daniel's legitimate business role and support their fabricated version of events.

6.2.4 Evidence destruction is a criminal offense and constitutes **obstruction of justice** and **evidence tampering**.

---

## PART C: RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS

### 7. RESPONSE TO CLAIM: "DANIEL IS DELUSIONAL"

#### 7.1 The Gaslighting Tactic

7.1.1 The Applicant claims that Daniel's memories of running the businesses are "delusions."

7.1.2 This is a classic **gaslighting tactic** - attempting to make someone question their own documented experiences and memories.

7.1.3 The purpose of this tactic is to discredit Daniel's truthful account by suggesting he is mentally unstable.

#### 7.2 The Documentary Evidence Proves Daniel's Sanity

7.2.1 The Shopify Email (**Annexure JF1**) proves that Daniel was CC'd on business communications from 2017, establishing his legitimate involvement from the beginning.

7.2.2 Daniel's "memories" are not delusions - they are **documented historical facts**.

7.2.3 The evidence shows:
- Daniel was involved in business operations (proven by CC on Shopify Email);
- Daniel and Kayla operated independently (proven by direct client management);
- Daniel's account is consistent with contemporaneous documentary evidence.

7.2.4 The Applicant's gaslighting claim is exposed as false by objective documentary evidence.

---

### 8. RESPONSE TO CLAIM: "JACQUI HAS DEMENTIA"

#### 8.1 The Attack on My Credibility

8.1.1 The Applicant claims that I suffer from "dementia" and that my testimony supporting Daniel is unreliable due to cognitive impairment.

8.1.2 This claim is **false, defamatory, and constitutes elder abuse**.

8.1.3 The purpose of this claim is to discredit the primary witness (myself) who can testify to the truth about Daniel and Kayla's independent business operations.

#### 8.2 My Cognitive Capacity is Proven

8.2.1 I have attached medical records as **Annexure JF11** that demonstrate I do not suffer from dementia or any cognitive impairment.

8.2.2 My testimony in this affidavit is detailed, coherent, and **perfectly aligned with the documentary evidence** (particularly the Shopify Email).

8.2.3 The fact that my account matches the objective historical record (the Shopify Email) proves my cognitive reliability.

8.2.4 If I had dementia, my testimony would be inconsistent and contradictory. Instead, it is perfectly consistent with contemporaneous documentary evidence from 2017.

#### 8.3 Why the Applicant Attacks My Credibility

8.3.1 The Applicant attacks my credibility because I am the **key witness** who can testify to:
- The 2016 forced separation (which I witnessed personally);
- Daniel and Kayla's independent business building (which I observed firsthand);
- The Applicant's lack of involvement in Daniel's operations (which I can confirm);
- The truth about the business relationships.

8.3.2 By falsely claiming I have dementia, the Applicant seeks to eliminate my testimony and prevent the truth from being heard.

8.3.3 This tactic demonstrates the Applicant's **consciousness of guilt** - he knows my testimony will expose his false narrative.

---

### 9. RESPONSE TO CLAIM: "HEAD OFFICE ALWAYS CONTROLLED OPERATIONS"

#### 9.1 The False Historical Revisionism

9.1.1 The Applicant claims that a centralized "head office" (controlled by him) always managed all business operations, including those of Daniel and Kayla.

9.1.2 This claim represents **systematic historical revisionism** designed to legitimize the post-death appropriation of Daniel and Kayla's businesses.

9.1.3 The claim is completely contradicted by the Shopify Email and other documentary evidence.

#### 9.2 The Evidence Refutes Centralized Control

9.2.1 The Shopify Email (**Annexure JF1**) shows:
- Kayla communicated directly with Shopify (no intermediary);
- She used personal email addresses (kayp@rzo.io, kayla@regima.zone);
- She provided personal contact information (011 615 29869);
- She represented Unicorn Dynamics Pty Ltd (an independent company);
- There is **no mention** of any "head office" or centralized control.

9.2.2 The correspondence evidence (**Annexure JF5**) shows:
- Daniel and Kayla managed client relationships directly;
- They made independent business decisions;
- They operated their own accounting systems;
- They had their own Shopify subscriptions.

9.2.3 The financial evidence (**Annexures JF3, JF4, JF10**) shows:
- Separate bank accounts for Daniel's companies;
- Independent financial management;
- No evidence of centralized financial control.

#### 9.3 The "Head Office" Claim is a Post-Death Fabrication

9.3.1 The "head office" narrative was created **after Kayla's death** to justify the appropriation of businesses the Applicant did not build.

9.3.2 The evidence destruction (Shopify audit trails on 22 May 2025) was necessary to eliminate proof that contradicted this false narrative.

9.3.3 The Applicant's claim is not supported by any contemporaneous documentary evidence from the period when the businesses were being built (2016-2019).

10.2.2 These records show:
- Proper accounting for all director loans;

#### 10.3 Bank Records - Daniel Faucitt

10.3.2 These records demonstrate:

- Legitimate business transactions.

10.3.3 Daniel has provided full financial disclosure, which contradicts the Applicant's claims of financial misconduct.

10.4.2 This analysis shows:
- The financial structure of Daniel and Kayla's independent businesses;

- The appropriation of these revenue streams following Kayla's death.

10.4.3 The financial evidence supports Daniel's account and refutes the Applicant's claims.

- Resolve disputes through communication;
- Cooperate with legitimate requests.

11.2.2 These efforts were met with:
- Refusal to engage;
- System access restrictions;
- Escalating demands;
- False accusations.

#### 11.3 The Applicant's Refusal to Cooperate

11.3.1 The correspondence evidence (**Annexure JF5, particularly JF8C**) demonstrates the Applicant's systematic refusal to engage in good faith.

11.3.2 Instead of cooperation, the Applicant chose:
- Litigation;
- False accusations;
- Gaslighting tactics;
- Evidence destruction.

11.3.3 The Applicant's conduct demonstrates that this application is not about resolving legitimate disputes - it is about appropriating businesses through legal process.

---

12.2 This includes:

14.2 These packages contain organized evidence submissions showing the progressive gathering of evidence and the development of our case.

14.3 The chronological organization demonstrates the systematic nature of our evidence gathering and the thoroughness of our response.

---

### 15. TIMELINE ANALYSIS

15.1 I attach as **Annexure JF9** a comprehensive timeline analysis.

15.2 This timeline establishes:
- The chronological sequence of events from 2016 to present;

---

## PART F: LEGAL GROUNDS FOR OPPOSITION

- The Applicant has engaged in evidence destruction and gaslighting;
- The Application is based on a fabricated narrative designed to appropriate businesses.

#### 17.2 Abuse of Process

17.2.1 The Application constitutes an abuse of process because:
- It is brought to legitimize criminal appropriation through legal process;
- It relies on false allegations and misrepresentations;
- It is part of a pattern of harassment and intimidation;
- It seeks to use the Court to validate a false narrative.

#### 17.3 Bad Faith

17.3.1 The Application is brought in bad faith because:
- The Applicant knows his claims are false (as evidenced by evidence destruction);
- The Applicant is attempting to gaslight witnesses (Daniel and myself);
- The Applicant refuses to engage in good faith resolution;
- The Applicant's conduct demonstrates consciousness of guilt.

---
