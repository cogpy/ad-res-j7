## PART B: MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT

### 2. THE 2016 FORCED SEPARATION: MY EXPERIENCE

#### 2.1 The Day Everything Changed

2.1.1 I will never forget the day in **2016** when the Applicant (my brother Peter) physically ejected me and Kayla Pretorius from the office premises.

2.1.2 The incident occurred following a business disagreement. The Applicant:
- Became physically aggressive and forced us to leave the premises;
- Instructed all staff members to ignore any instructions from me;
- Confiscated our equipment, including our personal laptops and computers;
- Told us explicitly: **"You're on your own nowâ€”buy your own laptops, pay for your own office."**

2.1.3 This was not a temporary disagreement or a cooling-off period. The Applicant made it absolutely clear that we were severed from his business operations and would receive no support, resources, or assistance from him.

2.1.4 At that moment, Kayla and I faced a choice: give up on our business ambitions, or build something completely independent. We chose the latter.

#### 2.2 The Emotional and Financial Impact

2.2.1 The forced separation was devastating, both emotionally and financially:
- We had no office space;
- We had no equipment (our laptops had been confiscated);
- We had no immediate source of income;
- We had to start from scratch.

2.2.2 However, Kayla and I were determined. We decided to build legitimate, independent business operations that would prove we could succeed without the Applicant's involvement.

---

### 3. BUILDING INDEPENDENT BUSINESSES WITH KAYLA (2016-2019)

#### 3.1 Operating from My Home

3.1.1 From 2016 onwards, Kayla and I operated from my residential property.

3.1.2 We converted a room in my home into an office space. We purchased our own equipment, furniture, and supplies.

3.1.3 My mother (Jacqueline Faucitt, the First Respondent) witnessed this firsthand. She saw us working long hours, building our businesses from the ground up.

#### 3.2 Incorporating Independent Companies

3.2.1 Between 2016 and 2017, Kayla and I incorporated **five independent companies**:

**a) Unicorn Dynamics (Pty) Ltd** (2016/307425/07)
- Incorporated: 2016
- Purpose: E-commerce operations
- Directors: Myself (sole director)

**b) ReZonance (Pty) Ltd** (2017/081396/07)
- Incorporated: 2017
- Purpose: Business operations and consulting
- Directors: Myself (sole director)

**c) RegimA Zone (Pty) Ltd** (2017/110437/07)
- Incorporated: 2017
- Purpose: E-commerce and distribution
- Directors: Myself (sole director)

**d) RegimA Zone Academy (Pty) Ltd** (2017/113134/07)
- Incorporated: 2017
- Purpose: Training and education
- Directors: Myself (sole director)

**e) RegimA Zone Impact (Pty) Ltd** (2017/109415/07)
- Incorporated: 2017
- Purpose: Social impact initiatives
- Directors: Myself (sole director)

3.2.2 These companies were **completely independent** of the Applicant's entities. I was the sole director of each company, and the Applicant had no involvement in their incorporation, management, or operations.

#### 3.3 Self-Funding Our Operations

3.3.1 Kayla and I self-funded all aspects of our business operations, including:

**Equipment and Infrastructure**:
- Laptops and computers (to replace those confiscated by the Applicant);
- Servers and networking equipment;
- Office furniture and supplies;
- Printers, scanners, and other peripherals.

**Software and Subscriptions**:
- **Shopify Plus subscriptions** (as evidenced by the Shopify Email - **Annexure JF1**);
- QuickBooks accounting systems;
- Email hosting and domain registrations;
- Marketing and analytics tools.

**Operating Expenses**:
- Internet and telecommunications;
- Electricity and utilities;
- Marketing and advertising;
- Shipping and logistics;
- Professional services (accounting, legal, etc.).

3.3.2 Every expense was paid from our own resources. We received **no financial support** from the Applicant.

3.3.3 The financial records (**Annexure JF3**) and bank statements (**Annexure JF4**) prove our independent financial management.

#### 3.4 Building Client Relationships

3.4.1 Kayla and I built direct client relationships without any involvement from the Applicant.

3.4.2 The Shopify Plus email (**Annexure JF1**) proves this conclusively:
- Kayla personally managed the Shopify Plus onboarding;
- She communicated directly with Shopify's Launch Manager (Richard Estabrooks);
- She used her personal email addresses: kayp@rzo.io and kayla@regima.zone;
- She provided her personal phone number: **011 615 29869**;
- I was CC'd on the communications, demonstrating my involvement.

3.4.3 There was **no "head office" involvement**, no intermediary, and no centralized control by the Applicant. We managed our client relationships directly and independently.

---

### 4. KAYLA PRETORIUS: MY BUSINESS PARTNER AND FRIEND

#### 4.1 Kayla's Role in Our Businesses

4.1.1 **Kayla Pretorius** was not just my business partner - she was my friend, my collaborator, and the co-founder of everything we built after the 2016 separation.

4.1.2 Kayla was brilliant, hardworking, and dedicated. She had a natural talent for business operations and client management.

4.1.3 The Shopify Email (**Annexure JF1**) demonstrates Kayla's central role:
- She was the primary contact for Shopify Plus;
- She managed the onboarding process;
- She made business decisions;
- She represented our companies in external communications.

4.1.4 Without Kayla, I could not have built what we built. She was essential to our success.

#### 4.2 Kayla's Untimely Death

4.2.1 Kayla's death was a devastating personal loss and a catastrophic blow to our businesses.

4.2.2 Kayla was the person who could have testified definitively about:
- The 2016 forced separation;
- Our independent business building;
- The Applicant's lack of involvement in our operations;
- The truth about who built and managed our businesses.

4.2.3 The timing of the Applicant's actions following Kayla's death is significant and suspicious:
- Kayla could no longer defend the truth;
- The Applicant immediately began appropriating our businesses;
- The Applicant created a false "head office" narrative;
- The Applicant destroyed evidence (Shopify audit trails) that would have proven Kayla's role.

---

### 5. THE SHOPIFY PLUS EMAIL: PROOF OF OUR INDEPENDENT OPERATIONS

#### 5.1 Why This Email is Critical

5.1.1 The **Shopify Plus email dated 26 July 2017** (**Annexure JF1**) is the single most important piece of evidence in this matter.

5.1.2 This email is what my mother correctly calls a "**forensic time capsule**" - an unalterable historical record from a neutral third party (Shopify Inc.) that proves our independent business operations.

5.1.3 The Applicant cannot dispute this email. He cannot alter it. He cannot explain it away. It is contemporaneous documentary evidence that demolishes his false narrative.

#### 5.2 What the Email Proves About My Business

5.2.1 The Shopify Email proves the following facts about my business operations:

**a) I was directly involved in business operations**
- I was CC'd on the Shopify Plus onboarding email;
- This proves I was a key decision-maker, not a peripheral figure;
- My involvement was documented by Shopify, a third-party service provider.

**b) Kayla and I operated independently**
- Kayla managed the Shopify relationship directly, without any "head office" involvement;
- She used personal email addresses (kayp@rzo.io, kayla@regima.zone), not centralized corporate emails;
- She provided personal contact information (011 615 29869), not a centralized switchboard.

**c) We represented independent companies**
- The email shows Kayla representing **Unicorn Dynamics Pty Ltd**;
- This was one of the five companies I incorporated independently;
- The company was operating under its own identity, not as a subsidiary of the Applicant's entities.

**d) No centralized control existed**
- There is **zero evidence** in the email of any "head office" or centralized management;
- All communications were direct between Kayla and Shopify;
- The Applicant is not mentioned anywhere in the correspondence.

#### 5.3 The Email Demolishes the Applicant's Claims

5.3.1 The Applicant claims that:
- I never operated independent businesses;
- All operations were controlled by "head office" (meaning him);
- I am "delusional" about my role in the businesses.

5.3.2 The Shopify Email proves that **every one of these claims is false**:
- I was CC'd on business communications, proving my legitimate involvement;
- Kayla managed client relationships directly, proving no centralized control;
- The documentary evidence validates my account, proving I am not delusional.

5.3.3 The Applicant's entire narrative collapses in the face of this single piece of documentary evidence.

---

### 6. THE SYSTEMATIC APPROPRIATION AFTER KAYLA'S DEATH

#### 6.1 The Timeline of Appropriation

6.1.1 Following Kayla's death, the Applicant and his associates systematically appropriated the businesses that Kayla and I had built.

6.1.2 The timeline (**Annexure JF9**) shows the following sequence:

**Kayla's Death**: The person who could testify to the truth is gone.

**Immediate Appropriation**:
- Revenue streams were hijacked;
- Phone numbers were appropriated (including Kayla's 011 615 29869);
- Business operations were taken over;
- Client relationships were redirected.

**May 15, 2025**: My mother (Jacqueline) confronted the Applicant about missing funds.

**May 22, 2025**: Exactly **seven days later**, the Shopify audit trails were destroyed.

**Ongoing**: The Applicant deployed a gaslighting campaign claiming I am "delusional" and my mother has "dementia."

#### 6.2 The Phone Number Appropriation

6.2.1 The Shopify Email shows Kayla's phone number: **011 615 29869**.

6.2.2 After Kayla's death, this phone number was **appropriated** by the Applicant or his associates.

6.2.3 This appropriation is significant because:
- It represents **identity theft** - taking over Kayla's business identity;
- It provides **direct physical evidence** of the systematic appropriation;
- It demonstrates the Applicant's intent to erase Kayla's role and claim her work as his own.

6.2.4 The phone number appropriation is just one example of the systematic takeover of everything Kayla and I built.

---

### 7. THE MAY 22, 2025 EVIDENCE DESTRUCTION

#### 7.1 The Deliberate Destruction of Shopify Records

7.1.1 On **May 22, 2025**, the Shopify audit trails were systematically destroyed.

7.1.2 This was not an accident. It was a deliberate act designed to eliminate evidence that would prove:
- Kayla's role as the primary Shopify account manager;
- My involvement in business operations;
- The independent nature of our business structure;
- The falsity of the Applicant's "head office" narrative.

7.1.3 The timing is critical: the destruction occurred exactly **seven days** after my mother confronted the Applicant about missing funds.

#### 7.2 What the Destroyed Records Would Have Shown

7.2.1 The destroyed Shopify audit trails would have shown:
- The complete history of Shopify Plus account management from 2017 onwards;
- Kayla's role as the primary account administrator;
- My involvement in account decisions and operations;
- The absence of any "head office" or centralized control;
- The independent management structure that Kayla and I established.

7.2.2 These records would have provided comprehensive proof of our independent operations and would have completely demolished the Applicant's false narrative.

#### 7.3 Consciousness of Guilt

7.3.1 The evidence destruction demonstrates **consciousness of guilt**.

7.3.2 The Applicant and his associates knew that the Shopify records contradicted their false claims. By destroying these records, they sought to eliminate proof of the truth.

7.3.3 Evidence destruction is a serious criminal offense. It constitutes:
- **Obstruction of justice**;
- **Evidence tampering**;
- **Defeating the ends of justice**.

7.3.4 I respectfully submit that this conduct should be referred to criminal authorities for investigation and prosecution.

### 8. RESPONSE TO THE "DELUSIONAL" CLAIM

#### 8.1 The Gaslighting Tactic Against Me

8.1.1 The Applicant claims that I am "delusional" about my role in the businesses.

8.1.2 This is a classic **gaslighting tactic** designed to:
- Make me question my own memories and experiences;
- Discredit my testimony by suggesting mental instability;
- Undermine my credibility as a witness.

8.1.3 The purpose is to make people believe that my account of building independent businesses with Kayla is a fabrication or delusion, rather than documented historical fact.

#### 8.2 The Documentary Evidence Proves My Sanity

8.2.1 The Shopify Email (**Annexure JF1**) provides objective, third-party validation of my account:
- I was CC'd on business communications from 2017;
- This proves my legitimate involvement in business operations;
- My "memories" are not delusions - they are documented facts.

8.2.2 Additional evidence supporting my account includes:
- Company incorporation records showing I am the sole director of five companies;
- Financial records showing independent financial management (**Annexures JF3, JF4**);
- Correspondence showing direct client relationship management (**Annexure JF5**);
- Timeline analysis showing chronological consistency (**Annexure JF9**).

8.2.3 If I were truly delusional, my account would be:
- Inconsistent with documentary evidence;
- Contradicted by third-party records;
- Incoherent and changing over time.

8.2.4 Instead, my account is:
- **Perfectly consistent** with the Shopify Email and other documentary evidence;
- **Corroborated** by third-party records from Shopify, banks, and government registries;
- **Coherent and stable** over time.

8.2.5 The documentary evidence proves that I am not delusional - I am telling the truth, and the Applicant is lying.

---

### 9. MY MOTHER'S TESTIMONY IS CREDIBLE

#### 9.1 The Attack on My Mother

9.1.1 The Applicant claims that my mother (Jacqueline Faucitt, the First Respondent) suffers from "dementia" and that her testimony is unreliable.

9.1.2 This claim is **false, cruel, and constitutes elder abuse**.

9.1.3 The Applicant attacks my mother's credibility because she is the **key witness** who can testify to:
- The 2016 forced separation (which she witnessed personally);
- My independent business building with Kayla (which she observed firsthand);
- The Applicant's lack of involvement in my operations;
- The truth about the family business relationships.

#### 9.2 My Mother's Cognitive Capacity

9.2.1 My mother does **not** have dementia. She is cognitively sharp, articulate, and her memory is excellent.

9.2.2 The medical records (**Annexure JF11**) prove that she does not suffer from any cognitive impairment.

9.2.3 More importantly, my mother's testimony is **perfectly aligned with the documentary evidence**:
- Her account of the 2016 separation matches the timeline;
- Her description of my independent business building is corroborated by the Shopify Email;
- Her testimony is consistent with all objective evidence.

9.2.4 If my mother had dementia, her testimony would be confused, contradictory, and inconsistent with the facts. Instead, it is clear, coherent, and validated by documentary evidence.

#### 9.3 Why the Applicant Attacks My Mother

9.3.1 The Applicant attacks my mother because he **fears her testimony**.

9.3.2 My mother is the one person who witnessed the entire history of events:
- She saw the 2016 forced separation;
- She witnessed Kayla and me building our businesses from my home;
- She observed the Applicant's lack of involvement;
- She can testify to the truth.

9.3.3 By falsely claiming she has dementia, the Applicant seeks to eliminate the most credible witness against him.

9.3.4 This tactic demonstrates the Applicant's **consciousness of guilt** - he knows my mother's testimony will expose his lies.

---

### 10. FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY

#### 10.1 My Financial Records

10.1.1 I have provided complete financial transparency through:
- **Bank statements** (**Annexure JF4**): My personal bank records from June 2025 to October 2025;
- **Financial analysis** (**Annexure JF3**): Comprehensive financial records and analysis;
- **Director loan accounts** (**Annexure JF10**): Accounting records showing proper financial management.

10.1.2 These records demonstrate:
- Legitimate business transactions;
- Proper accounting practices;
- No evidence of fraud or misappropriation;
- Complete financial transparency.

#### 10.2 Refuting Financial Misconduct Claims

10.2.1 The Applicant makes various claims about financial misconduct, debt, and misappropriation.

10.2.2 The financial records (**Annexures JF3, JF4, JF10**) refute these claims completely:
- All transactions are documented and legitimate;
- Director loan accounts are properly recorded;
- There is no evidence of hidden assets or misappropriation;
- The financial management is transparent and above board.

10.2.3 The Applicant's financial allegations are baseless and unsupported by evidence.

---

### 11. COOPERATION AND GOOD FAITH

#### 11.1 My Attempts to Cooperate

11.1.1 The correspondence evidence (**Annexure JF5**, particularly the JF8 series) demonstrates my repeated attempts to:
- Engage constructively with the Applicant;
- Provide information and documentation;
- Resolve disputes through communication;
- Cooperate with legitimate requests.

11.1.2 I have acted in good faith throughout this matter, despite the Applicant's false accusations and gaslighting tactics.

#### 11.2 The Applicant's Refusal to Engage

11.2.1 The correspondence evidence shows that the Applicant has:
- Refused to engage in good faith discussions;
- Imposed system access restrictions (**JF8D**);
- Escalated to litigation rather than resolution;
- Deployed false accusations and gaslighting.

11.2.2 The Applicant's conduct demonstrates that this application is not about resolving legitimate disputes - it is about appropriating my businesses through legal process.

---

## PART C: LEGAL GROUNDS AND RELIEF

### 12. THE APPLICATION SHOULD BE DISMISSED

#### 12.1 Lack of Factual Basis

12.1.1 The Application should be dismissed because the Applicant's factual allegations are contradicted by documentary evidence:
- The Shopify Email proves I operated independent businesses;
- The financial records prove legitimate financial management;
- The correspondence proves my good faith cooperation;
- The timeline proves the systematic appropriation after Kayla's death.

#### 12.2 Abuse of Process

12.2.1 The Application constitutes an abuse of process because:
- It is brought to legitimize criminal appropriation through legal means;
- It relies on false allegations (gaslighting claims about delusion and dementia);
- It is part of a pattern of harassment following evidence destruction;
- It seeks to use the Court to validate a fabricated narrative.

#### 12.3 Bad Faith

12.3.1 The Application is brought in bad faith, as evidenced by:
- The evidence destruction on May 22, 2025 (consciousness of guilt);
- The gaslighting tactics against myself and my mother;
- The refusal to engage in good faith resolution;
- The systematic appropriation of businesses following Kayla's death.

---

### 13. CRIMINAL CONDUCT AND REFERRAL

#### 13.1 Serious Criminal Offenses

13.1.1 The evidence demonstrates serious criminal conduct that should be referred to criminal authorities:

**a) Fraud**
- Systematic misrepresentation to appropriate businesses;

- Fabricated narrative to legitimize theft.

**b) Identity Theft**
- Appropriation of Kayla's phone number (011 615 29869);
- Appropriation of business identities;
- Taking over Kayla's client relationships.

- Obstruction of justice;
- Defeating the ends of justice.

**d) Perjury (if applicable)**

- False claims about "head office" control contradicted by documentary evidence.

13.1.2 I respectfully request that this Honourable Court refer these matters to the appropriate criminal authorities for investigation and prosecution.

---

### 14. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

I respectfully pray that this Honourable Court:

14.1 **Dismiss the Application** with costs on an attorney-and-client scale;

14.2 **Declare** that I operated legitimate, independent businesses with Kayla Pretorius, as proven by the Shopify Plus email dated 26 July 2017 and other documentary evidence;

14.3 **Declare** that the Applicant's claims are based on false premises and constitute an attempt to appropriate businesses through legal process;

14.4 **Declare** that the Applicant engaged in evidence destruction by destroying Shopify audit trails on 22 May 2025;

14.5 **Refer** this matter to the appropriate criminal authorities for investigation of fraud, identity theft, evidence destruction, and related offenses;

14.7 **Order** the Applicant to:
- Return all appropriated business assets and revenue streams;
- Provide a full accounting of all funds taken from my businesses;
- Pay damages for business appropriation and defamation;

14.8 **Grant** such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems just and equitable.

---

## PART D: CONCLUSION

### 15. SUMMARY

15.1 The evidence in this matter is overwhelming:
- The **Shopify Plus email dated 26 July 2017** is irrefutable proof that Kayla and I operated independent businesses;
- The Applicant's claims are contradicted by contemporaneous documentary evidence from neutral third parties;
- The Applicant engaged in evidence destruction to eliminate proof of the truth;
- The Applicant deployed gaslighting tactics to discredit truthful witnesses;
- The Application is an abuse of process designed to appropriate my businesses through legal means.

15.2 I built legitimate businesses with Kayla Pretorius. We worked hard, invested our own resources, and created something valuable.

15.3 After Kayla's death, the Applicant systematically appropriated what we built, destroyed evidence of our legitimate operations, and fabricated a false narrative to legitimize his theft.

15.4 I respectfully submit that the Application should be dismissed, the Applicant's criminal conduct should be referred for prosecution, and justice should be served.
