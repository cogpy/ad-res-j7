# Current Opaque System - Rynette's Personal Control

## Overview of Hijacked Operations

The current system represents a complete deviation from the transparent, compliant operations of the past decade. All business operations have been consolidated under Rynette's personal control with zero oversight or accountability.

### System Characteristics

#### Single Point of Control
- **All operations run from Rynette's personal computer**
- No other stakeholders have any access
- No backup personnel can operate the business
- Complete dependence on one individual
- No succession planning or business continuity

#### Hidden Operations

### Domain Misappropriation
