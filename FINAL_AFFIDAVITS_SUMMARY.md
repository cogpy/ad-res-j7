- Material non-disclosure cascade (7 separate non-disclosures)
- Conclusion and relief sought

### Key Arguments

1. **Material Non-Disclosure (8 major non-disclosures)**:
   - Responsible Person regulatory crisis (37 jurisdictions)
   - Settlement agreement signed 8 days before interdict
   - Investment payout in 9 months (financial motive)
   - Transfer of control to non-director bookkeeper
   - Applicant's own unilateral actions causing disruption
   - Historical collaborative business model
   - Director loan account structure
   - Quantified disproportionate harm (136:1 ratio)

2. **IT Expenses Justified (R6.7M+)**:
   - 37-jurisdiction operations require substantial infrastructure
   - Industry benchmarks support 10-18% of revenue for multi-jurisdiction e-commerce
   - Detailed breakdown by category (Shopify Plus, AWS, Microsoft 365, etc.)
   - Applicant restricted access to documentation, then demanded documentation

3. **R500K Payment Properly Authorized**:
   - Established practice spanning decades
   - Signatory authority + accounting allocation
   - Applicant participated in identical practice
   - Director loan account repayment (company owes directors millions)

4. **Platform Ownership Counter-Claim**:
   - Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd) owns Shopify platform
   - RWD generated R2.94M-R6.88M on platform without paying owner
   - Unjust enrichment: R140K-R280K+ in platform costs unpaid
   - Peter questions R500K while enabling millions in unjust enrichment

5. **Quantified Harm Analysis**:
   - Alleged concerns: R500,000
   - Documented losses: R18,141,647.70+
   - Regulatory exposure: R50,000,000+
   - **Harm ratio: 136:1** (remedy worse than alleged disease)

6. **Pattern of Bad Faith**:
   - Manufactured crisis (card cancellations after cooperation)
   - Impossible demands (restrict access, then demand documentation)
   - Bypassing existing powers (absolute trust powers unused)
   - Suspicious timing (settlement → interdict → investment payout)
   - Material non-disclosures (7 separate non-disclosures)
   - Coordinated attack (settlement as Trojan horse)

### Key Arguments (Same as Complete, Focused on Critical)

1. **Responsible Person Crisis** - Immediate regulatory non-compliance in 37 jurisdictions
2. **IT Expenses Justified** - R6.7M+ necessary for international operations
3. **R500K Payment Authorized** - Established practice, Applicant's hypocrisy
4. **Platform Ownership Counter-Claim** - R2.94M-R6.88M unjust enrichment
