## 8. PROPOSED COURT ARGUMENT

### Opening Statement:
> "Your Lordship, this Court has been deceived. What was presented as a business dispute requiring an interdict is actually a criminal enterprise that has hijacked entire businesses. The supposed 'threats' to the business - my clients - are actually hemorrhaging R100,000 per month from personal funds to keep the businesses alive while receiving zero revenue due to criminal conduct. The interdict is not protecting businesses; it is protecting criminals."

### Key Points:
1. Personal financial hemorrhage proves good faith
2. Criminal timeline shows premeditation
3. Ongoing harm requires immediate intervention
4. Public interest demands criminal prosecution

**We need immediate action to:**
1. Set aside the interdict
