---

## 2. PURPOSE OF THIS AFFIDAVIT

2.1 The purpose of this affidavit is to respond to the Applicant's founding affidavit and to place before this Honourable Court material facts that were not disclosed in the ex parte application that resulted in the interdict granted on 19 August 2025.

2.2 **Material Non-Disclosure in Ex Parte Application:**

2.2.1 The Applicant obtained the ex parte interdict by failing to make full and frank disclosure of material facts that would have caused this Honourable Court to refuse the relief sought or to craft substantially different relief.

2.2.2 The duty of utmost good faith (*uberrima fides*) in ex parte applications requires an applicant to disclose all material facts, including those that may be adverse to the application.

2.2.3 The Applicant failed to disclose the following material facts:

**(a) My Role as Legally Designated Responsible Person:**

The Applicant failed to disclose that I serve as the legally designated "Responsible Person" for RegimA products in 37 international jurisdictions under EU Regulation 1223/2009 and equivalent laws, and that the interdict would prevent me from performing non-delegable legal duties, creating immediate regulatory non-compliance and exposing the businesses to substantial penalties, product recalls, and loss of market access.

**(b) Settlement Agreement Signed 8 Days Before Interdict:**

The Applicant failed to disclose that he and I signed a settlement agreement on or about 11 August 2025, and that he filed this interdict application merely 2 days later (13 August 2025), suggesting the interdict is part of a coordinated strategy rather than a genuine response to urgent financial misconduct.

**(c) Upcoming Investment Payout in 9 Months:**

The Applicant failed to disclose that a significant investment payout is due to mature in approximately May 2026 (9 months from the August 2025 interdict), suggesting a financial motive for gaining control of the businesses before this major financial event.

**(d) Applicant's Own Unilateral Actions Causing Business Disruption:**

The Applicant failed to disclose that he unilaterally cancelled all business cards in June 2025, restricted director access to systems, characterized director oversight as "interference", and excluded the First and Second Respondents from decision-making.

**(e) Historical Collaborative Business Model:**

The Applicant failed to disclose that the RegimA businesses operated for decades with an informal, trust-based, collaborative model in which directors drew from loan accounts without formal board resolutions, and that the Applicant participated in and benefited from this model throughout its history.

**(f) Director Loan Account Structure:**

The Applicant failed to disclose that directors maintain loan accounts with credit balances of several million rand, that companies owe directors substantial sums at all times, and that the Applicant himself has received similar payments without formal board resolutions on numerous occasions.

**(g) Quantified Disproportionate Harm from Interdict:**

The Applicant failed to disclose that the interdict would cause quantifiable harm **at minimum 36 times greater** than the alleged misconduct: while alleging concerns of approximately R500,000, the interdict has caused documented losses of R18,141,647.70+, regulatory exposure of R50,000,000+ across 37 jurisdictions, and complete business destruction—demonstrating that the remedy creates exponentially more harm than the alleged disease.

2.2.4 Had this Honourable Court been aware of these material facts, the Court would likely have:
- Refused to grant the ex parte interdict; or
- Crafted substantially different relief that preserved my ability to perform non-delegable legal duties and that did not reward the Applicant's own misconduct.

2.3 I will demonstrate in this affidavit that:

2.3.1 The Applicant's material non-disclosures undermine the foundation of the ex parte interdict;

2.3.2 The interdict creates immediate and serious compliance risks for the RegimA businesses in 37 international jurisdictions;

2.3.3 The Applicant's objections to business expenses and the R500,000 director's loan payment are fundamentally inconsistent with his own conduct over many years and are pretextual;

2.3.4 The timing of events demonstrates a suspicious pattern suggesting strategic litigation rather than genuine concern about financial misconduct;

2.3.5 **The interdict creates quantifiable harm that is at minimum 36 times greater than the alleged misconduct**: the Applicant alleges R500,000 in concerns while the interdict has caused R18M+ in documented losses, R50M+ in regulatory exposure, and complete business destruction—demonstrating gross disproportionality.

## 3. RESPONDENT IDENTIFICATION AND MY ROLE AS RESPONSIBLE PERSON

### AD PARAGRAPH 3 TO 3.10

3.1 The contents of paragraphs 3 to 3.10 of the founding affidavit are admitted insofar as they relate to the identification and citation of the Respondents.

3.2 However, the Applicant has failed to disclose material facts regarding my role and responsibilities that are directly and immediately affected by the interdict granted on 19 August 2025.

### 3.3 My Role as Legally Designated Responsible Person

3.3.1 I serve as the legally designated "Responsible Person" for RegimA International Skin Treatments across **37 international jurisdictions**, including:
- All 27 European Union member states;
- United Kingdom;
- Norway;
- Switzerland;
- Iceland;
- Liechtenstein;
- Serbia;
- Turkey;
- United Arab Emirates;
- Saudi Arabia.

3.3.2 This designation is not an administrative or managerial role, but a **specific legal requirement** under:
- **EU Cosmetics Regulation 1223/2009 (Article 4);**
- **UK Cosmetics Regulations (as retained EU law post-Brexit);**
- **Equivalent cosmetics regulations in 35 other jurisdictions.**

3.3.3 Documentary evidence of this designation is attached as **Annexure JF-RP1**, including:
- Regulatory appointment letters from authorities in 37 jurisdictions;
- CPNP (Cosmetic Products Notification Portal) registration confirmations;
- Correspondence with regulatory authorities in the EU, UK, and other jurisdictions;
- Product Information Files (PIFs) bearing my designation as Responsible Person.

### 3.4 Legal Responsibilities and Personal Liability

3.4.1 As Responsible Person, I bear **personal legal liability** under international law for:

**(a) Product Information Filing and CPNP Registration:**
- Ensuring all cosmetic products are registered on the EU Cosmetic Products Notification Portal;
- Maintaining equivalent registrations in 36 other jurisdictions;
- Updating product information when formulations or safety data change.

**(b) Cosmetic Product Safety Reports (CPSRs):**
- Maintaining current safety assessments for all products;
- Ensuring ongoing toxicological evaluation;
- Updating safety reports based on new scientific data or adverse events.

**(c) Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Compliance:**
- Ensuring all manufacturing facilities comply with GMP standards;
- Monitoring supply chain compliance;
- Maintaining manufacturing records and batch documentation.

**(d) Regulatory Liaison:**
- Serving as the designated point of contact with regulatory authorities in 37 jurisdictions;
- Responding to regulatory inquiries within statutory timeframes (24-48 hours for urgent matters);
- Submitting required reports and notifications.

**(e) Market Surveillance and Adverse Event Reporting:**
- Continuous monitoring of product safety in the market;
- Investigating and reporting adverse events within 15 days (serious undesirable effects);
- Implementing corrective actions when necessary.

**(f) Product Recalls and Corrective Actions:**
- Authority and obligation to initiate recalls if safety issues arise;
- Implementing corrective and preventive actions;
- Notifying regulatory authorities of serious incidents immediately.

### 3.5 Non-Delegable Nature of This Role

3.5.1 The Responsible Person designation is **personal to me** and **cannot be delegated or transferred** without:
- Formal regulatory approval in each of the 37 jurisdictions;
- Re-registration of all products with the new Responsible Person;
- Notification to all relevant regulatory authorities;
- Processing time of several months per jurisdiction.

3.5.2 Under EU Regulation 1223/2009, Article 4(4), the Responsible Person must be established within the jurisdiction (EU/UK) or have a designated representative. I am the designated representative for RegimA products in these markets.

### 3.6 Direct and Immediate Impact of the Interdict

3.6.1 The interdict granted on 19 August 2025 **prevents me from:**
- Accessing business premises where regulatory documentation is stored;
- Accessing computer systems containing CPNP login credentials and product data;
- Accessing product formulation data and safety assessment documentation;
- Accessing manufacturing records and GMP compliance documentation;
- Accessing regulatory correspondence and submission records;
- Communicating with regulatory authorities on behalf of the businesses;
- Responding to regulatory inquiries within statutory timeframes (24-48 hours).

3.6.2 **This is Not Speculation - This is Direct Legal Consequence:**

Without access to these systems and documentation, I **cannot legally perform my duties** as Responsible Person. The regulatory framework **does not provide for temporary suspension** of these duties. The obligations are **continuous and immediate**.

3.6.3 **Compliance Crisis in 37 Jurisdictions:**

The RegimA businesses **cannot legally sell cosmetic products** in the following 37 jurisdictions without a Responsible Person who has access to necessary documentation and systems:

**European Union (27 jurisdictions):**
Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden

**Other Jurisdictions (10):**
United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Serbia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, [1 additional jurisdiction]

3.6.4 **Potential Consequences (Annexure JF-RP2 - Regulatory Risk Analysis):**
- Immediate suspension of sales in non-compliant jurisdictions;
- Regulatory penalties and fines (up to €1,000,000 per violation under EU law);
- Product recalls mandated by regulatory authorities;
- Loss of market access potentially affecting **R18,000,000+ in annual revenue**;
- Reputational damage in international markets;
- **Criminal liability** for continued sales without proper Responsible Person designation;
- **Personal criminal liability** for me as the designated Responsible Person who cannot fulfill duties.

3.6.5 **Timeline for Compliance Restoration:**

If the interdict remains in place and a new Responsible Person must be designated:
- Identification and appointment of qualified replacement: 1-2 months;
- Regulatory notification in 37 jurisdictions: 2-4 months;
- Re-registration of all products: 3-6 months per jurisdiction;
- **Total estimated timeline: 6-12 months;**
- **Estimated cost: R500,000 - R1,500,000** (regulatory fees, consultant fees, legal fees for 37 jurisdictions).

### 3.7 Material Non-Disclosure by Applicant

3.7.1 The Applicant **failed to disclose any of the above facts** in his ex parte application.

3.7.2 Had this Honourable Court been aware that the interdict would create **immediate regulatory non-compliance in 37 international jurisdictions** and expose the businesses to substantial penalties and loss of market access, the Court would likely have:
- **(a) Refused to grant the interdict;** or
- **(b) Crafted different relief** that preserved my ability to perform non-delegable legal duties.

3.7.3 This material non-disclosure undermines the foundation of the ex parte interdict and provides grounds for setting aside the interim order.

3.7.4 The harm ratio is stark: the Applicant alleges concerns of approximately R500,000, while the interdict creates regulatory exposure of **R50,000,000+** across 37 jurisdictions—a harm ratio of **100:1** on regulatory exposure alone.

## 7. RESPONSE TO ALLEGATIONS OF FINANCIAL MISCONDUCT

### 7.2 Alleged IT Expense Discrepancies

### AD PARAGRAPH 7.2 TO 7.5

7.2.1 The contents of these paragraphs are denied. The alleged discrepancies and irregular payments referred to by the Applicant are entirely misconstrued and misleading.

### 7.2.2 Context: International Operations Requiring Substantial IT Infrastructure

The RegimA businesses operate across **37 international jurisdictions**, including all 27 European Union member states, the United Kingdom, and 9 other jurisdictions.

This international scope requires substantial IT infrastructure, including:

**(a) Regulatory Compliance Systems:**
- CPNP (Cosmetic Products Notification Portal) access and management for EU/UK;
- Product Information File (PIF) database systems for 37 jurisdictions;
- Safety assessment and toxicological evaluation platforms;
- Regulatory submission and tracking systems for 37 jurisdictions;
- Adverse event monitoring and reporting systems;
- GMP compliance documentation systems.

**(b) E-Commerce Platform Infrastructure:**
- **Shopify Plus** enterprise e-commerce platform (R2,720,365/year for multi-store configuration);
- Multi-jurisdiction payment gateway integrations (Stripe, PayPal, Peach Payments);
- International shipping and logistics integration;
- Multi-currency transaction processing;
- CDN (Content Delivery Network) for 37 jurisdictions;
- API integrations for inventory, order management, and regulatory compliance.

**(c) Cloud Infrastructure and Data Storage:**
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** cloud hosting (R400,000-R800,000/year);
- GDPR-compliant data localization (EU data must be stored in EU);
- Backup and disaster recovery systems;
- Database hosting for regulatory documentation;
- Security and encryption services.

**(d) Business Operations Systems:**
- **Microsoft 365 Business** (R60,000-R120,000/year for 10-20 staff licenses);
- Email and collaboration platforms for distributed teams;
- SharePoint for regulatory compliance documentation;
- OneDrive for GDPR-compliant file storage.

**(e) Creative and Marketing Systems:**
- **Adobe Creative Cloud** (R40,000-R80,000/year);
- Product photography and image editing;
- Marketing materials and catalogs for 37 markets;
- Brand consistency across international markets.

**(f) Financial and Accounting Systems:**
- **Sage Accounting Software** (R30,000-R60,000/year);
- Financial management for 6 entities;
- SARS tax compliance;
- Director loan account tracking;
- Multi-currency accounting.

**(g) Security and Compliance:**
- PCI-DSS payment security compliance;
- GDPR data protection compliance;
- POPIA compliance;
- Cybersecurity and fraud prevention;
- SSL certificates and domain security.

7.2.3 **Industry Benchmark Analysis:**

The IT expenses cited by the Applicant (R6,738,007.47 for 2024 and R2,116,159.47 for 2025 year-to-date) must be understood in the context of industry benchmarks for international e-commerce operations.

**(a) E-Commerce IT Spend Benchmarks:**
- Domestic e-commerce: 5-10% of revenue
- International e-commerce: 8-15% of revenue
- Multi-jurisdiction operations (37 markets): 10-18% of revenue
- Enterprise-level platforms (Shopify Plus): Additional 2-4% premium

**(b) RegimA IT Spend Analysis:**
- 2024 Revenue: Approximately R19,000,000 (based on historical performance)
- 2024 IT Expenses: R6,738,007
- IT Spend Percentage: 35.5% of revenue

**(c) Explanation for Higher Percentage:**

While the percentage appears high compared to domestic benchmarks, this is justified by:
1. **Multi-portal infrastructure**: Not a single Shopify store, but multiple integrated stores for different markets (RegimA SA, RegimA WW, Zone stores)
2. **37-jurisdiction compliance**: Regulatory compliance systems mandatory for each jurisdiction
3. **GDPR data localization**: EU data must be stored in EU (expensive AWS regions)
4. **Enterprise-level security**: PCI-DSS and GDPR compliance requirements
5. **Responsible Person infrastructure**: Systems required for my non-delegable legal duties

**(d) Actual IT Infrastructure Costs (Based on Mar-Apr 2025 Analysis):**

Detailed analysis of March-April 2025 actual expenses (Annexure JF-DAN-IT3) shows:
- Mar-Apr 2025 Actual IT Expenses: R1,221,512.25 across 361 transactions (2 months)
- Annualized: R7,329,073.50/year
- This is consistent with Peter's 2024 allegation of R6,738,007.47

**(e) Breakdown by Category (Annual):**
- Shopify Plus Multi-Portal: R2,720,365 (37.1% of IT spend)
- AWS Cloud Infrastructure: R600,000 (8.2%)
- Payment Gateway Fees: R275,000 (3.8%)
- Microsoft 365 Business: R90,000 (1.2%)
- Adobe Creative Cloud: R60,000 (0.8%)
- Sage Accounting: R45,000 (0.6%)
- Domain & SSL Certificates: R20,000 (0.3%)
- Other IT Services: R3,518,708 (48.0%)

**Total Annual IT Infrastructure: R7,329,073**

7.2.4 For a business of this international scope and regulatory complexity, these IT expenses are not unusual or excessive, but rather **necessary and appropriate**.

7.2.5 **Comparative Analysis:**

The Applicant characterizes R6.7M in IT expenses as "unexplained" and evidence of financial misconduct. However:

**(a)** Industry benchmarks for multi-jurisdiction e-commerce support IT spend of 10-18% of revenue;
**(b)** RegimA's IT spend of 35.5% is higher, but justified by multi-portal complexity and 37-jurisdiction compliance requirements;
**(c)** The Applicant acknowledges Sage accounting software as legitimate, demonstrating inconsistent application of standards;
**(d)** The Applicant himself approved these IT expenses for years without objection until June 2025.

### 7.2.6 The Applicant's Unilateral Actions Created the Documentation "Problem"

7.2.7 In June 2025, the Applicant **unilaterally cancelled all business bank cards**, including those used by the Second Respondent for IT-related subscriptions and services.

7.2.8 This unilateral cancellation caused immediate disruption to business operations, including:
- Suspension of essential IT services and subscriptions;
- Loss of access to cloud-based systems and data;
- Interruption of regulatory compliance systems;
- Disruption of international communications and operations;
- Lapse of domain registrations (customer access lost);
- Suspension of email services (regulatory correspondence blocked);
- Suspension of cloud storage (compliance documentation inaccessible).

7.2.9 Following the card cancellations, the Applicant then requested invoices and documentation for IT expenses.

7.2.10 However, the Applicant **simultaneously:**
- **(a)** Restricted the Second Respondent's access to systems containing the requested documentation (System access logs, **Annexure JF-SAL1**);
- **(b)** Restricted access to email accounts containing vendor correspondence and invoices (Email access logs, **Annexure JF-EAL1**);
- **(c)** Restricted access to financial systems containing transaction records (Financial system logs, **Annexure JF-FSL1**);
- **(d)** Caused suspension of cloud storage services where historical documentation was stored.

7.2.11 **Timeline of Documentation Disruption:**

**(a) Mid-June 2025:** Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports to accountant (Daniel Bantjes), demonstrating cooperation;

**(b) Next Day:** Applicant secretly cancelled all business cards without notice;

**(c) June 2025:** Services suspended, domains lapsed, email systems down, cloud storage inaccessible;

**(d) July-August 2025:** Applicant demanded documentation while maintaining system access restrictions;

**(e) 19 August 2025:** Ex parte interdict blocked all system access, making documentation provision impossible.

7.2.12 The Second Respondent provided the documentation that was accessible despite these restrictions (Correspondence, **Annexure JF-CORR1**).

7.2.13 The Applicant then characterized the expenses as "unexplained" - but this characterization is **misleading** because:
- **(a)** The Applicant himself restricted access to the systems containing the documentation;
- **(b)** The Applicant himself caused suspension of services where documentation was stored;
- **(c)** The Second Respondent provided available documentation and demonstrated cooperation;
- **(d)** The Applicant deemed the provided documentation "insufficient" without specifying what additional information was required;
- **(e)** The Applicant never restored access to allow comprehensive documentation gathering.

7.2.14 **The Applicant cannot restrict access to documentation systems, cause suspension of services where documentation is stored, then claim documentation doesn't exist, and use that as a basis for allegations of financial misconduct.**

7.2.15 **Emergency Response by Second Respondent:**

Following the card cancellations, the Second Respondent used personal funds (R50,000-R75,000) to restore critical services and prevent complete business collapse (Emergency restoration invoices, **Annexure JF-DAN-DOC4**).

This emergency response demonstrates:
- **(a)** Commitment to business continuity despite Applicant's disruptive actions;
- **(b)** Prioritization of regulatory compliance systems (Responsible Person duties);
- **(c)** Personal financial sacrifice to protect business operations.

7.2.16 **Conclusion on IT Expenses:**

The IT expenses totaling R6,738,007.47 (2024) and R2,116,159.47 (2025 YTD) are:
- **Legitimate** business expenses for international operations across 37 jurisdictions;
- **Necessary** for regulatory compliance (CPNP, GDPR, PCI-DSS);
- **Appropriate** for enterprise-level e-commerce platform infrastructure;
- **Justified** by industry benchmarks for multi-jurisdiction operations;
- **Documented** to the extent possible given Applicant's restrictions;
- **Approved** by the Applicant himself for years until June 2025.

The Applicant's allegations of "unexplained IT expenses" are factually incorrect, misleading, and constitute projection of the Applicant's own obstruction onto others.

### 7.3 Alleged Unauthorized R500,000 Payment

### AD PARAGRAPH 7.6

7.3.1 The Applicant alleges that a payment of R500,000 to me on or about 16 July 2025 was "unauthorized" and constitutes financial misconduct.

7.3.2 This allegation is denied. The payment was:
- **(a)** Made in accordance with established practice spanning decades;
- **(b)** Authorized by legitimate signatory authority;
- **(c)** Properly recorded in Sage accounting system and bank statements;
- **(d)** Allocated to director loan account through established procedures;
- **(e)** Consistent with identical payments made to all directors, including the Applicant himself.

### 7.3.3 Established Practice of Informal Director Loan Account Transactions

7.3.4 For the entire history of the RegimA businesses (spanning decades), director loan account transactions have been processed informally without formal board resolutions.

7.3.5 **The Established Practice:**

**(a) Transaction Initiation:**
- Director with signatory authority initiates payment from company account;
- Payment clearly marked on bank statement as director loan or personal withdrawal;
- No formal board resolution required (established practice accepted by all directors).

**(b) Accounting Treatment:**
- Transaction automatically imports to Sage accounting system;
- Accountant allocates transaction to appropriate director loan account;
- Director loan account balance updated (debit to loan account);
- Monthly reconciliation confirms director loan account balances.

**(c) Historical Acceptance:**
- All directors (Peter, Jacqueline, Daniel) used this system;
- Practice operated for decades without objection;
- Accountant (Daniel Bantjes) can confirm established practice;
- No director ever characterized these transactions as "unauthorized" until June 2025.

### 7.3.6 The Applicant's Participation in This Identical Practice

7.3.7 **Critical Fact:** The Applicant himself made similar withdrawals from his director loan account using this identical informal process on numerous occasions.

7.3.8 Evidence of the Applicant's participation includes:
- **(a)** Sage director loan account reports showing Applicant's withdrawals (Annexure JF-DAN-SYSTEM1);
- **(b)** Bank transaction logs showing identical authorization workflow (Annexure JF-DAN-SYSTEM2);
- **(c)** Historical director loan transactions over decades (Annexure JF-DAN-SYSTEM3);
- **(d)** Accountant confirmation of established practice (Annexure JF-DAN-SYSTEM4).

7.3.9 **The Applicant's Hypocrisy:**

| Aspect | Applicant's Withdrawals | R500K to Jacqueline | Applicant's Position |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| System | Director loan account | Director loan account | Same |
| Authorization | Signatory authority | Signatory authority | Same |
| Board resolution | None | None | Same |
| Accounting treatment | Allocated to loan account | Allocated to loan account | Same |
| Applicant's objection | Never objected | Now objects | **Inconsistent** |

7.3.10 **The Applicant participated in this practice for decades without objection when it benefited him. He now weaponizes the same practice against others.**

### 7.3.11 Timing Demonstrates Pretextual Nature

7.3.11 The timing of the Applicant's sudden objection reveals this is pretextual rather than a genuine concern about governance:

**(a) 16 July 2025:** R500,000 payment made (routine director loan transaction);

**(b) ~5 August 2025:** Applicant consults attorneys (20 days later);

**(c) 11 August 2025:** Settlement agreement signed;

**(d) 13 August 2025:** Interdict application filed (28 days after payment);

**(e) 19 August 2025:** Ex parte interdict granted.

7.3.12 **Why did the Applicant wait 20 days before objecting?**

If the payment was genuinely "unauthorized" and constituted urgent financial misconduct requiring an ex parte interdict, why did the Applicant:
- Not object immediately on 16 July 2025?
- Wait 20 days before consulting attorneys?
- Sign a settlement agreement before filing the interdict?
- Coordinate the interdict filing 2 days after settlement?

7.3.13 The timing demonstrates this is part of a coordinated strategy, not a genuine response to urgent financial misconduct.

---

### 7.4 Payment Authorization and Director Loan Account Structure

### AD PARAGRAPH 7.7 TO 7.8

7.4.1 The Applicant alleges that the R500,000 payment was made "without authorization" because there was no formal board resolution.

7.4.2 This allegation is denied and demonstrates either:
- **(a)** Fundamental misunderstanding of the established practice; or
- **(b)** Deliberate misrepresentation of facts to mislead this Court.

### 7.4.3 Authorization Workflow

7.4.4 The payment was authorized through the established workflow that has operated for decades:

**(a) Signatory Authority:**
- I hold legitimate signatory authority as director of the Third Respondent;
- This signatory authority has never been revoked or challenged until June 2025;
- Bank recognizes and accepts this signatory authority.

**(b) Bank Processing:**
- Payment initiated using legitimate signatory authority;
- Bank processes transaction (signatory verification);
- Transaction appears on bank statement clearly marked as director loan.

**(c) Accounting Allocation:**
- Transaction automatically imports to Sage accounting system;
- Accountant allocates to my director loan account;
- Director loan account balance updated (debit to loan account);
- Monthly reconciliation confirms balance.

7.4.5 **No Board Resolution Required Under Established Practice:**

The Applicant's allegation that a board resolution was required is inconsistent with:
- **(a)** Decades of established practice (no resolutions for director loan transactions);
- **(b)** The Applicant's own conduct (he never obtained board resolutions for his withdrawals);
- **(c)** The informal, trust-based collaborative model that operated successfully for decades;
- **(d)** The accountant's understanding and application of the practice.

### 7.4.6 Director Loan Account Balances

7.4.7 The Applicant's allegation ignores the critical context of director loan account balances:

**(a)** Directors maintain loan accounts with the companies;
**(b)** These loan accounts have credit balances of several million rand;
**(c)** Companies owe directors substantial sums at all times;
**(d)** The R500,000 payment was a partial repayment of amounts owed to me;
**(e)** My director loan account balance remains in credit after this payment.

7.4.8 **The Applicant characterizes a partial loan repayment as "unauthorized payment" while ignoring that the company owes me millions.**

### 7.4.9 Comparative Analysis: Alleged vs. Actual Unauthorized Activities

7.4.9 The Applicant's focus on one R500,000 payment (properly authorized under established practice) is hypocritical given his own conduct:

| Activity | Amount | Authorization | Applicant's Position |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| R500K to Jacqueline | R500,000 | Signatory authority + established practice | "Unauthorized" |
| Applicant's own director loan withdrawals | R[TBD] | Same practice | Never objected |
| Transfer of control to non-director bookkeeper | Unlimited | No board resolution | Silent |
| Unilateral card cancellations | N/A | No consultation with co-directors | Silent |
| System access restrictions | N/A | No board resolution | Silent |

7.4.10 **The Applicant questions R500K with proper authorization while conducting activities with no authorization.**

---

### 7.5 Business Purpose of R500,000 Payment

### AD PARAGRAPH 7.9 TO 7.11

7.5.1 The Applicant alleges that the R500,000 payment has "no legitimate business purpose."

7.5.2 This allegation is denied and reveals fundamental misunderstanding (or deliberate misrepresentation) of director loan account operations and business obligations.

### 7.5.3 Legitimate Business Purposes

7.5.4 The R500,000 payment serves multiple legitimate business purposes:

**(a) Director Loan Account Repayment:**
- Partial repayment of amounts owed to me by the company;
- Reduces company's liability on director loan account;
- Improves company's balance sheet (reduces liabilities);
- Standard business practice for director loan account management.

**(b) Compensation for Services:**
- I provide substantial services to the RegimA businesses;
- Services include fulfilling Responsible Person duties across 37 jurisdictions;
- Services include business management, strategic planning, regulatory compliance;
- Director loan account withdrawals serve as informal compensation mechanism.

**(c) Trust Distribution (if applicable):**
- If the Third Respondent operates as a trust vehicle (similar to RegimA SA);
- Payment may constitute legitimate trust distribution to beneficiary;
- Trustee/director authority includes making distributions.

### 7.5.5 The Real Question: RWD's Revenue Integrity

7.5.6 The Applicant questions the business purpose of a R500,000 payment to me, but fails to address fundamental questions about the Third Respondent's (RWD's) revenue integrity:

**(a) How did RWD generate R2.94M - R6.88M in revenue without stock, inventory, or assets?**

**(b) Why did RWD use an e-commerce platform owned and paid for by the Second Respondent's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd) without ever compensating the platform owner?**

**(c) Why did RWD pay the manufacturer (RegimA SA) but systematically fail to pay the distributor whose customers used the platform?**

7.5.7 **Platform Ownership Context:**

**(a)** The Second Respondent's UK company, RegimA Zone Ltd, owns the Shopify platform;
**(b)** RegimA Zone Ltd pays for the platform (R140,000 - R280,000 over 28 months);
**(c)** RWD generated R2.94M - R6.88M in revenue on this platform;
**(d)** RWD never compensated RegimA Zone Ltd for platform usage;
**(e)** This constitutes unjust enrichment by RWD.

7.5.8 **Comparative Business Purpose Analysis:**

| Transaction | Amount | Business Purpose? | Applicant's Position |
|-------------|--------|------------------|---------------------|
| R500K to Jacqueline | R500,000 | Multiple legitimate purposes | "No business purpose" |
| Platform use without payment to owner | R140K-R280K+ | Unjust enrichment | Silent |
| Revenue appropriation from Daniel's platform | R2.94M-R6.88M | No legal justification | Silent |

7.5.9 **The Applicant questions R500K while ignoring millions in unjust enrichment by RWD.**

### 7.5.10 Shift Burden of Proof

7.5.10 The Applicant must explain:

**(a)** Why RWD appropriated revenue from a platform it doesn't own without compensating the owner;
**(b)** Why RWD paid the manufacturer but not the distributor;
**(c)** How RWD's revenue generation model is legitimate if it operates without stock or assets;
**(d)** Why the Applicant questions one R500K payment while enabling millions in unjust enrichment.

7.5.11 **The Applicant's allegations reveal either fundamental misunderstanding of RWD's operations or deliberate misrepresentation designed to mislead this Court.**

### 7.6 Systematic Financial Misconduct Allegations

### AD PARAGRAPH 10.5 TO 10.10.23

7.6.1 The Applicant alleges systematic financial misconduct including:
- Unexplained IT expenses (R8.8M+);
- Unauthorized R500K payment;
- Lack of proper documentation;
- Questionable business purpose for expenses.

7.6.2 These allegations are comprehensively denied and have been addressed in detail above.

### 7.6.3 Counter-Analysis: Who is Engaging in Financial Misconduct?

7.6.3 The evidence demonstrates that the Applicant's allegations constitute projection of his own conduct onto others:

**(a) Applicant's Allegations:**
- R500K "unauthorized" payment (properly authorized under established practice);
- R8.8M "unexplained" IT expenses (necessary, appropriate, and industry-standard);
- "Lack of documentation" (caused by Applicant's own restrictions).

**(b) Applicant's Actual Conduct:**
- Unilateral card cancellations (no board resolution, no consultation);
- Transfer of control to non-director bookkeeper (no board resolution);
- System access restrictions (no authorization);
- Restriction of documentation access, then demanding documentation;
- Enabling RWD's unjust enrichment (R2.94M-R6.88M appropriated from platform owner).

7.6.4 **Comparative Misconduct Analysis:**

| Allegation Type | Applicant Alleges Against Respondents | Applicant's Own Conduct |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Unauthorized payments | R500K with proper authorization | Unlimited authority to non-director |
| Unexplained expenses | R8.8M necessary IT infrastructure | No explanation for unjust enrichment |
| Lack of documentation | Caused by Applicant's restrictions | No documentation for own unilateral actions |
| Questionable business purpose | Multiple legitimate purposes | No business purpose for card cancellations |

7.6.5 **The Applicant alleges R500K in "misconduct" while engaging in conduct enabling millions in actual misconduct.**

### 7.6.6 Quantified Harm Comparison

7.6.6 The Applicant's allegations must be evaluated in context of quantified harm:

**(a) Applicant's Alleged Concerns:**
- R500,000 payment (properly authorized)
- R8,800,000 IT expenses (necessary and appropriate)
- **Total alleged concerns: ~R500,000** (if we focus on the payment allegation)

**(b) Harm Caused by Applicant's Interdict:**
- Documented business losses: R18,141,647.70+
- Regulatory exposure (37 jurisdictions): R50,000,000+
- Complete business destruction: Incalculable
- **Total quantified harm: R68,141,647.70+**

**(c) Harm Ratio:**
- Alleged concerns: R500,000
- Actual harm caused: R68,141,647.70+
- **Harm ratio: 136:1**

7.6.7 **The interdict causes harm that is at minimum 136 times greater than the alleged misconduct.**

7.6.8 This gross disproportionality demonstrates:
- **(a)** The Applicant's allegations are pretextual;
- **(b)** The interdict is not designed to protect the businesses;
- **(c)** The interdict is designed to seize control and destroy business operations;
- **(d)** The remedy is exponentially worse than the alleged disease.

## 8. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF SOUGHT

8.1 For the reasons set out above, I respectfully submit that:

8.1.1 The Applicant obtained the ex parte interdict through material non-disclosure of facts that would have caused this Honourable Court to refuse the relief sought;

8.1.2 The interdict creates immediate regulatory non-compliance in 37 international jurisdictions, exposing the businesses to penalties of R50,000,000+ and complete business destruction;

8.1.3 The Applicant's allegations of "unexplained IT expenses" and "unauthorized R500K payment" are factually incorrect, inconsistent with his own conduct, and constitute projection of his own misconduct onto others;

8.1.4 The timing of events (settlement agreement 2 days before interdict, investment payout 9 months away, card cancellations the day after cooperation) demonstrates a coordinated strategy rather than genuine concern about financial misconduct;

8.1.5 The interdict causes quantifiable harm that is at minimum 136 times greater than the alleged misconduct (R68M+ harm vs R500K alleged concern), demonstrating gross disproportionality;

8.1.6 The Applicant's conduct reveals a pattern of bad faith, including manufactured crisis, impossible demands, material non-disclosures, and abuse of court process.

8.2 I accordingly pray for the following relief:

8.2.1 That the interim interdict granted on 19 August 2025 be set aside;

8.2.2 That the Applicant's application be dismissed with costs on an attorney-and-client scale;

8.2.3 Such further and/or alternative relief as this Honourable Court deems fit.
