## SYSTEM FEATURES

### 1. Strategy Prioritization

Strategies are prioritized by:
1. **Priority Level** (1 = Critical, 2 = High, 3 = Medium)
2. **Dependencies** (complete prerequisite strategies first)
3. **Estimated Effort** (prefer lower effort when priority equal)

### 2. Dependency Management

The system automatically:
- Identifies strategy dependencies
- Ensures prerequisites are completed first
- Prevents implementation of dependent strategies
- Calculates optimal implementation sequence

### 3. Progress Tracking

Tracks three implementation states:
- **Completed:** Strategy file exists and is documented
- **In Progress:** Strategy file partially complete
- **Pending:** Strategy not yet started

### 4. Optimal Sequencing

Algorithm generates optimal implementation sequence:
```
1. Sort by priority (critical first)
2. Check dependencies (all met?)
3. Sort by effort (quick wins first)
4. Return prioritized sequence
```

### 5. Reporting

Generates comprehensive reports:
- **Overview:** Completion rate, totals, estimates
- **By Category:** Status per strategic category
- **Critical Path:** Priority 1 items pending
- **Quick Wins:** ≤6 hour strategies
- **Bottlenecks:** Complex or blocking strategies
- **Recommendations:** Actionable next steps

---

## CURRENT STATUS (October 16, 2025)

### Summary

- **Total Strategies:** 10
- **Completed:** 7 (70%)
- **Pending:** 3 (30%)
- **Critical Path:** 0 pending (100% complete!)
- **Estimated Completion:** 5 days (34 hours)

### Completion by Category

| Category | Total | Complete | Pending | Rate |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|------|
| Material Non-Disclosure | 2 | 2 | 0 | 100% |
| Financial Misconduct | 2 | 2 | 0 | 100% |
| Responsible Person | 2 | 1 | 1 | 50% |
| Business Disruption | 2 | 1 | 1 | 50% |
| Timing Patterns | 1 | 1 | 0 | 100% |
| Disproportionate Harm | 1 | 1 | 0 | 100% |
| Peter's Hypocrisy | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0% |

### Critical Path Status

✅ **All critical path (Priority 1) strategies are complete!**

This means:
- Core defense arguments are documented
- Highest impact strategies implemented
- Foundation for setting aside interdict established
- Primary evidence for disproportionate harm collected

---

## INTEGRATION WITH EVIDENCE COLLECTION

### Synchronized Workflows

The strategy system integrates with `optimal-evidence-collector.js`:

```javascript
/ Strategy system tracks WHAT arguments to make
/ Evidence system tracks WHAT evidence is needed
/ Integration ensures coordination

Evidence Needed → Strategy Implementation → Evidence Collection
     ↓                      ↓                        ↓
  JF-RP1-2         Responsible Person Strategy    Document collection
  JF-DLA1-3        R500K Payment Strategy          Bank statements
  JF-BS1           Quantified Harm Strategy        Financial records
```

### Coordinated Recommendations

The integrated system provides:
- **Evidence gaps** that block strategy implementation
- **Strategy needs** that require evidence collection
- **Parallel work streams** for efficient execution
- **Priority alignment** across both systems

### Example Output

```
[Evidence] URGENT: 18 critical evidence items missing
[Strategy] CRITICAL: 0 critical strategy items pending
[Evidence] OPPORTUNITY: 5 quick wins available
[Strategy] OPPORTUNITY: 1 quick wins available
[Integrated] Focus: Evidence collection is bottleneck
```

## BEST PRACTICES

### For Strategy Implementation

1. **Complete Critical Path First**
   - Priority 1 strategies have highest impact
   - Foundation for all other strategies
   - Court-ready arguments

2. **Check Dependencies**
   - Don't start dependent strategies prematurely
   - Ensure prerequisite content available
   - Build on completed work

3. **Pursue Quick Wins**
   - ≤6 hour strategies build momentum
   - High value for low effort
   - Boost completion rate

4. **Address Bottlenecks**
   - Complex strategies need dedicated time
   - Blocking strategies prevent downstream work
   - Plan accordingly

5. **Document Thoroughly**
   - Each strategy file should be court-ready
   - Include evidence references
   - Follow established format

### For System Maintenance

1. **Update Strategy Status**
   - Mark strategies complete when files created
   - Update file paths in system
   - Regenerate reports

2. **Add New Strategies**
   - Follow established format
   - Assign appropriate priority
   - Define clear dependencies
   - Estimate effort realistically

3. **Review Dependencies**
   - Ensure dependencies are accurate
   - Update as strategies evolve
   - Remove circular dependencies

4. **Monitor Integration**
   - Check evidence-strategy alignment
   - Identify gaps in coordination
   - Ensure synchronized progress

   - Application to current case
   - Expected impact on proceedings

4. **Relief Sought**
   - Specific remedies requested
   - Legal basis for relief
   - Expected outcome

5. **Annexures**
   - Supporting documents
   - Evidence references
   - Legal authorities
