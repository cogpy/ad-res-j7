## Strategic Framework Evolution

### Seven Key Arguments Established

The revised affidavit (v3) establishes seven strategic arguments:

1. **Material Non-Disclosure** - Peter obtained interdict through fraud (ex parte application)
2. **Peter's Inconsistency** - Accepted informal practices for years, now weaponizes them
3. **Peter Created Problems** - Card cancellations, system lockouts, Rynette empowerment
4. **Timing Reveals Motive** - Settlement manipulation → 2 days → interdict → 9 months → payout
5. **Pattern of Misrepresentation** - Settlement agreement, R500K payment, IT expenses, Chesno fraud
6. **Daniel's Competence** - 8 years rescuing £500K+ fraud-damaged company
7. **Regulatory Crisis** - Interdict creates immediate non-compliance in 37 jurisdictions

### Critical Corrections in v3

Two critical corrections were made to the affidavit:

#### Paragraph 48 - Settlement Agreement Manipulation (JF5)
- Clarified: Gauteng Family Law Forum was **NOT** in original draft
- Added: Evidence of copy-paste manipulation
- Documented: "Has anything changed?" - "No, just details for attorneys" exchange
- Established: Fraud in the inducement argument

#### Paragraph 129 - Isaac Chesno Fraud
- Corrected: Isaac Chesno committed massive fraud (over £500,000)
- Documented: Chesno disappeared after stealing funds
- Established: Daniel spent **8 YEARS** restoring UK company to break-even
- Clarified: Daniel's appointment was **BECAUSE of Chesno's fraud**
- Exposed: Peter's deliberate mischaracterization demonstrates bad faith

## Outstanding Items and Recommendations

### Critical Evidence Gaps

Based on the jax-response README.md, the following critical evidence is still needed:

#### Must-Have (Not Yet Confirmed):
- ☐ Responsible Person documentation (37 jurisdictions) - JF-RP1
- ☐ Regulatory risk analysis - JF-RP2
- ☐ Director loan account statements (all 3 directors) - JF-DLA1, JF-DLA2, JF-DLA3
- ☐ Peter's own withdrawals (minimum 4 examples) - JF-PA1 through JF-PA4
- ☑ R500K payment bank statement (16 July 2025) - JF-BS1 ✅ OBTAINED (PDF on file)
- ☐ JF5 draft agreement (initial version reviewed)
- ☐ JF5 final agreement (signed version with changes)
- ☐ Comparison document highlighting all changes
- ☐ Daniel's witness statement re: "Has anything changed?" exchange
- ☐ UK tax residency documentation
- ☐ Chesno fraud documentation - JF-CHESNO1 through JF-CHESNO4
- ☐ Daniel's 8-year restoration evidence - JF-RESTORE1 through JF-RESTORE4

### Immediate Next Steps

3. **Cross-Reference Check** - Verify all annexure references
4. **Timeline Verification** - Confirm all dates are accurate
5. **Final Proofread** - Check consistency and clarity

### Repository Maintenance
