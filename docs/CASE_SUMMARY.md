## Case Background

This case involves a dispute between Peter Andrew Faucitt and his family members Jacqueline and Daniel Faucitt, concerning the management and financial affairs of several interconnected companies within the RegimA business ecosystem. Peter Faucitt has filed an application seeking to make agreements entered into on September 18, 2025, orders of court.

The applicant has made numerous allegations of financial misconduct, including unauthorized IT expenses, unauthorized birthday gifts, interference with staff, withholding of documentation, and general financial mismanagement. The respondents deny these allegations and assert that the interdict obtained by the applicant is void due to perjury and fraud.

## Key Allegations by Applicant

The applicant's founding affidavit contains several key allegations, which can be summarized as follows:

### Financial Misconduct

Peter Faucitt alleges that there were "numerous irregular payments" and "unexplained" IT expenses totaling R6,738,007.47 for 2024 and R2,116,159.47 for 2025. He claims that these expenses were not properly documented or justified.

### Unauthorized Birthday Gift

The applicant alleges that Jacqueline Faucitt transferred R500,000.00 to Daniel Faucitt as an unauthorized "birthday gift." He characterizes this as a misappropriation of company funds.

### Interference with Staff

Peter Faucitt alleges that the respondents interfered with corporate staff and withheld email access, disrupting business operations.

### Withholding of Documentation

The applicant claims that documentation and invoices were withheld, preventing him from properly reviewing the financial affairs of the companies.

## Respondents' Defense

The respondents have prepared a comprehensive defense that addresses each of the applicant's allegations. The key points of their defense are as follows:

### Voidness of Interdict Due to Perjury and Fraud

The respondents assert that the entire application and the interdict obtained therefrom is void ab initio due to perjury and fraud perpetrated upon the Court. They provide documentary evidence showing that the email address Pete@regima.com, which the applicant claims to control, is actually controlled by Rynette Farrar. This means that the applicant could not have directly received the emails he claims to have received, making his statements to the court false.

### Refutation of Alleged Unexplained IT Expenses

The respondents assert that all IT expenses were legitimate business expenses necessary for the operation of an international distribution company. They provide detailed explanations for each category of expense, including Shopify Plus subscriptions, web services, Microsoft 365 licenses, Adobe Creative Cloud, Sage accounting software, domain registrations, and payment gateway fees. 

**Itemized Breakdown:** The respondents have prepared a comprehensive breakdown showing IT expenses of 10-11% of revenue, which is within the industry standard of 8-15% for international e-commerce operations. See [evidence/IT_EXPENSES_BREAKDOWN.md](../evidence/IT_EXPENSES_BREAKDOWN.md) for detailed analysis covering:
- Shopify Plus (R300K-600K annually): Enterprise platform for 37 jurisdictions
- AWS Cloud (R400K-800K annually): Global hosting and GDPR compliance
- Microsoft 365 (R60K-120K annually): Business productivity for 10-20 staff
- Adobe Creative (R40K-80K annually): Product photography and marketing
- Sage Accounting (R30K-60K annually): Financial management for 6 entities
- Domains & SSL (R10K-30K annually): Website infrastructure and security
- Payment Gateways (R150K-400K annually): Stripe, PayPal, Peach Payments

They further assert that the applicant's claim that "we have almost no invoices for these items" is false, as all invoices were available but the applicant cancelled access cards and obtained a court order that prevented proper record retrieval.

### Refutation of Alleged Unauthorized Birthday Gift

The respondents assert that the payment was not a "gift" but constituted an authorized director's loan. They explain that the Second Respondent made the First Respondent aware of the situation, and the payment was recorded in company bank accounts to ensure audit trail compliance. They further assert that the First Respondent, as a co-director and member of the close corporation, had full authority to approve necessary loans.

### Refutation of Alleged Interference with Staff

The respondents assert that emergency measures were required to restore business operations after the applicant's erratic behavior in canceling payment cards, which caused domain names to lapse, essential services to be terminated, business email systems to fail, and customer communications to be disrupted. They explain that the Second Respondent worked to restore domain registrations using personal funds, reinstate email services for all staff, maintain business continuity, and protect customer relationships.

### Refutation of Alleged Withholding of Documentation

The respondents assert that the applicant himself created the documentation access problem by canceling payment cards linked to cloud storage accounts, causing accounting software subscriptions to lapse, terminating document management systems, and refusing to maintain essential business services. They explain that all documentation was and remains available through cloud storage systems, accounting software records, email archives, and physical files at company premises.

## Evidence Classification

The respondents have classified the evidence in this case into three categories:

### Part 1: Irrefutable Proof (25 Points)

This category includes documentary evidence that cannot be disputed, such as:

- Trust created December 5, 2013 (Deed of Trust)
- RWW and Villa Via transferred to trust June 18, 2014
- Bantjies installed as trustee July 2024
- "Main Trustee" signed August 11, 2025
- Ex parte interdict filed August 14/19, 2025 (3-8 days later)
- UK company paid $77,000+ for Shopify operations
- Villa Via 86% profit margin documented
- RWW 0 employees / all expenses documented

### Part 2: Strong Evidence (24 Points)

This category includes supporting documents that indicate facts but fall short of absolute proof, such as:

- Villa Via extraction amount (ZAR 4M+ estimated)
- Transfer pricing fraud (SLG to RST pattern)
- Peter and Rynette coordination (agency proven, coordination inferred)
- Premeditated attack on Jax (timeline strongly indicates)
- Consciousness of guilt (evidence destruction pattern)
- Jax as fraud detector (confrontation proven, status strongly indicated)
- "Main Trustee" unnecessary (October 2024 powers proven)
- Trustee fraud (civil breach proven, criminal requires prosecution)

### Part 3: Circumstantial/Inferred (26 Points)

This category includes logical inferences and probable scenarios without direct proof, such as:

- Peter's actual cognitive state (multiple explanations, unprovable)
- Exact Villa Via extraction amount (margin proven, exact total unknown)
- Peter/Rynette affair (alleged, not proven, not material)
- When Peter decided to attack (actions documented, timing unknown)
- Kayla's death as "murder" (repository mention, no evidence)
- Criminal conspiracy (coordination proven, criminal agreement requires prosecution)
- Total damages amount (components documented, total requires forensic analysis)

## Strategic Approach

The respondents' strategic approach is to build the affidavit core on the 25 points of irrefutable proof, strengthen the case with the 24 points of strong evidence (with appropriate qualification), and use the 26 points of circumstantial/inferred evidence cautiously or avoid them entirely. This approach is designed to ensure that every claim made in the affidavit is defensible under cross-examination and that the respondents avoid speculation that can be challenged.

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the respondents are to:

1. Use Part 1 (Irrefutable Proof) as the core foundation of the responding affidavit.
2. Integrate Part 2 (Strong Evidence) with appropriate qualification.
3. Selectively reference Part 3 (Circumstantial/Inferred) or avoid it entirely.
4. Obtain missing documents identified in Part 1.
5. Strengthen Part 2 points with additional evidence.
6. Investigate Part 3 points to move them to Part 2 or Part 1.

## Conclusion

This case involves a complex dispute between family members concerning the management and financial affairs of several interconnected companies. The respondents have prepared a comprehensive defense that addresses each of the applicant's allegations with documentary evidence and detailed explanations. The strategic approach is to focus on irrefutable proof and strong evidence, while avoiding speculation and unsubstantiated claims. The outcome of this case will depend on the court's assessment of the evidence and the credibility of the parties.
