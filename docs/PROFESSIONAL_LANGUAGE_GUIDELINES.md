# Professional Language Guidelines for Legal Documents

## Purpose
This document establishes guidelines to ensure all statements in legal documents are truthful, sincere, and represent an honest interpretation of available facts in light of governing laws. All language must remain professional and neutral while avoiding speculation, insults, name-calling, false accusations, or derogatory language.

## Core Principles

### 1. Truthfulness and Sincerity
- All statements must be based on verifiable facts and evidence
- Interpretations must be reasonable and supported by documentation
- Claims must be substantiated with specific references to evidence

### 2. Professional Neutrality
- Maintain objective, professional tone throughout
- Allow facts and evidence to speak for themselves
- Avoid emotional language or personal attacks

### 3. Evidence-Based Assertions
- Every allegation must be supported by documentary evidence
- Use specific documents, dates, amounts, and annexure references
- Avoid speculation or assumptions about motives or intentions

## Language Replacements

### Problematic Terms to Avoid
| Avoid | Replace With |
|-------|--------------|
| "weaponized" | "utilized" or "applied inconsistently" |
| "bad faith" | "material non-disclosure" or "inconsistent conduct" |
| "ulterior motive" | "timing raises questions" or "pattern of conduct" |
| "deliberately misleading" | "factually incorrect" or "mischaracterizes" |
| "manufactured crisis" | "created circumstances" or "caused disruption" |
| "orchestrated attack" | "coordinated actions" or "systematic approach" |

### Professional Alternatives
