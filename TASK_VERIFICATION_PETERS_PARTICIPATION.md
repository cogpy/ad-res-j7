## What Has Been Demonstrated

The documentation successfully establishes:

1. **Historical Participation**: Peter drew funds from his director loan account on numerous occasions without formal board resolutions

2. **Non-Objection**: Peter accepted this collaborative model for decades without requesting formal board resolutions or characterizing transactions as unauthorized

3. **Personal Benefit**: Peter's director loan account operated under identical principles, and he drew funds when needed without formal authorization procedures

4. **Hypocrisy and Inconsistency**: Comparative analysis shows Peter questions the R500K payment while having used the identical practice himself for years

5. **Strategic Legal Significance**: 
   - Undermines Peter's credibility
   - Reveals pretextual nature of allegations
   - Demonstrates bad faith and inconsistent standards
   - Establishes hypocrisy (acceptable for Peter, "misconduct" for others)

## Evidence Framework

The documentation includes appropriate placeholders for actual evidence to be obtained from external sources:

**Required Evidence** (specified in PARA_7_7-7_8.md, Lines 249-255):
- [ ] Annexure JF-PA1: Bank statement showing Peter's withdrawal (Date 1, Amount, Reference)
- [ ] Annexure JF-PA2: Bank statement showing Peter's withdrawal (Date 2, Amount, Reference)
- [ ] Annexure JF-PA3: Bank statement showing Peter's withdrawal (Date 3, Amount, Reference)
- [ ] Annexure JF-PA4: Bank statement showing Peter's withdrawal (Date 4, Amount, Reference)
- [ ] Annexure JF-DLA1: Peter's director loan account statement (multi-year history)
- [ ] Evidence of absence of board resolutions for Peter's withdrawals
- [ ] Historical financial records showing informal practice over decades

**Note**: These placeholders are appropriate as actual data must be obtained from the company's accountant and bank records. The documentation framework is complete and ready for data population.
