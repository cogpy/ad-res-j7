- **Mitigation:**
  - Use conservative estimates
  - Mark uncertainties clearly
  - Provide date ranges where exact dates unknown

**5. Point-by-Point Rebuttal (Issue #76)**

## Conclusion

The updated implementation plan addresses **12 critical priority issues** requiring approximately **62-88 hours** of work over **3-4 weeks**. The plan is structured in four phases:

1. **Evidence Collection** (Week 1): Build foundation with documentation, forensics, and witness statements
2. **Analysis and Validation** (Week 2): Complete financial analysis, external validation, and strategic analysis
3. **Rebuttal and Harm Analysis** (Week 3): Address allegations point-by-point and quantify disproportionate harm
4. **Finalization** (Week 4+): Attorney review and final preparation

**Critical Path:** Evidence collection → Financial analysis → Timeline/causation → Rebuttal matrix → Harm quantification → Attorney review

**Priority Focus:** Start with Tier 1 items (documentation log, email forensics, financial analysis, timeline) as these form the foundation for subsequent work.
