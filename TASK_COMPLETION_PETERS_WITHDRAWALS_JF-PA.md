3. **PA3:** Creates binding business practice (establishes pattern)
4. **PA4:** Eliminates possibility of accident (decisive evidence)

3. **Insert Actual Data:**
   - Replace all [PLACEHOLDER] markers with verified information
   - Insert specific dates, amounts, and references
   - Add transaction context and circumstances

4. **Legal Review:**
   - Attorney review of completed annexures
