---

## Executive Summary

This document splits the repository content into:
1. **CIVIL RESPONSE** - Immediate filing (rescission/setting aside of interdict)
2. **CRIMINAL CASE** - Post-interdict evidence gathering (requires company record access)

**Critical Timeline:** Civil response must be filed immediately to set aside interdict and restore access to company records, which are required for criminal case evidence gathering.

---

## PART 1: CIVIL RESPONSE (IMMEDIATE FILING)

### Purpose
Set aside the interdict granted ex parte on August 19, 2025, on multiple independent grounds.

### Filing Deadline
**IMMEDIATE** - Rescission application to be filed as soon as possible

### Legal Grounds (Three Independent Grounds)

**Ground 1: Bad Faith / Clean Hands Violation**
- Peter created the problems he complains about
- Violates clean hands doctrine
- Bars equitable relief

**Ground 2: Material Non-Disclosure**
- Peter failed to disclose material facts in ex parte application
- Interdict void ab initio
- Duty of utmost good faith violated

**Ground 3: Gross Disproportionality**
- 36:1 to 136:1 harm ratio
