# SECTION 1: THE ONGOING FINANCIAL HEMORRHAGE

## For Jax's Affidavit

### Opening Bombshell Paragraph
> "Since the interdict was granted, the Second Respondent and I have been personally hemorrhaging approximately R100,000 per month to maintain critical business infrastructure, while receiving ZERO revenue due to the systematic hijacking of our entire customer base, payment systems, and business operations by a criminal enterprise operated by the bookkeeper Rynette Farrar and her son's companies."

### Detailed Financial Breakdown

**Monthly Personal Payments (From Personal Accounts):**

| Service Category | Monthly Amount | Contract Duration | Business Impact |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Shopify Enterprise | R45,000 | Multi-year | 30+ stores, 20-year relationship |
| Microsoft Enterprise | R15,000 | Multi-year | All business systems |
| AWS Infrastructure | R20,000 | Annual | Entire tech stack |
| Domain & Hosting | R5,000 | Annual | Customer access |
| Other Critical Services | R15,000 | Various | Operations |
| **TOTAL MONTHLY** | **R100,000** | | **ZERO REVENUE** |

### The Hidden Crisis Paragraph
> "This Court was not informed that while the Applicant claims we are a threat to the businesses, we are actually funding these businesses entirely from personal funds while being completely locked out of all revenue streams. Every month this interdict remains in place, we personally lose R100,000 while the criminal enterprise operated by Rynette Farrar continues to steal our customers, destroy evidence, and operate our hijacked business infrastructure."

### Supporting Evidence Required
- **Annexure JF-PERSONAL-BANK**: Personal bank statements showing payments
- **Annexure JF-CONTRACTS**: Multi-year agreements requiring payment
- **Annexure JF-ZERO-REVENUE**: Company accounts showing no income
- **Annexure JF-INVOICE-PROOF**: Invoices being paid personally

# SECTION 2: THE RYNETTE/ADDERORY CRIMINAL TIMELINE

## The Premeditated Structure (April 2021)

### Company Registration Timeline
| Date | Company | Registration # | Purpose in Scheme |
|------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| April 14, 2021 | Luxury Products Online (Pty) Ltd | [Number] | Initial vehicle |
| April 29, 2021 | Luxure (Pty) Ltd | [Number] | Backup vehicle |
| April 30, 2021 | Adderory (Pty) Ltd | [Number] | Primary hijack vehicle |

**Key Point**: Three companies in 16 days = premeditated criminal structure

## Phase 1: The Infiltration (2021-2025)

### Conflict of Interest Timeline
1. **2021**: Adderory becomes RegimA supplier
2. **2021-2025**: Rynette processes Adderory invoices (self-dealing)
3. **2022-2025**: Strategic Logistics forced to sell below cost
4. **2023-2025**: Millions in stock "disappear" via journal entries

### Evidence of Self-Dealing
> "Ms. Rynette Farrar, while employed as bookkeeper, was simultaneously:
> - Processing invoices for her son's company (Adderory)
> - Approving payments to Adderory
> - Forcing competitors (Strategic Logistics) to sell below cost
> - Writing off millions in stock through unexplained journal entries"

## Phase 2: The Hijacking (April-June 2025)

### The 67-Day Criminal Timeline

| Date | Criminal Act | Evidence | Impact |
|------|-------------|----------|---------|
| April 14, 2025 | Bank accounts changed | Letter from Rynette | Revenue redirected |
| May 22, 2025 | Shopify audit trails destroyed | 30+ stores wiped | Evidence destroyed |
| May 29, 2025 | Regimaskin.co.za registered | WHOIS: Adderory | Customer hijacking |
| June 20, 2025 | Customers redirected | Email evidence | Business stolen |

### The Smoking Gun Paragraph
> "In a coordinated 67-day operation, Rynette Farrar:
> 1. Changed all company bank accounts (April 14)
> 2. Destroyed 30+ Shopify store audit trails (May 22)
> 3. Had Adderory register competing domain (May 29)
> 4. Redirected all customers to Adderory's site (June 20)
> This was not mismanagement - this was theft."

# SECTION 3: THE STRATEGIC LOGISTICS DESTRUCTION

## For Daniel's Affidavit

### Opening Impact Statement
> "My company, Strategic Logistics CC, has been systematically destroyed through anti-competitive conduct orchestrated by Rynette Farrar to benefit her son's company, Adderory (Pty) Ltd."

### Before and After Comparison

**Before Rynette's Control:**
- Profitable packaging supplier to RegimA
- Competitive pricing with 30-40% margins
- Regular monthly orders of R[amount]
- Growing business relationship

**After Rynette's Control:**
- Forced to sell at 10-20% below cost
- Orders redirected to Adderory
- Millions in supplied stock "written off"
- Company now technically insolvent

### Quantified Destruction

| Loss Category | Amount | Period | Evidence |
|--------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Below-cost sales | R[amount] | 2022-2025 | Invoices vs cost sheets |
| Stock write-offs | R[amount] | 2023-2025 | Journal entries |
| Lost business | R[amount] | 2022-2025 | Historical vs current |
| **TOTAL LOSSES** | **R[amount]** | | **Company destroyed** |

### The Criminal Pattern
> "This was not business competition - this was criminal conduct:
> 1. Rynette forced us to sell below cost
> 2. Rynette approved inflated Adderory prices
> 3. Rynette wrote off our delivered stock
> 4. Rynette redirected orders to Adderory
> The bookkeeper destroyed a competitor to benefit her son."

# SECTION 4: WHY THE INTERDICT MUST BE SET ASIDE

## The Perverse Protection of Criminals

### The Current Reality
> "This Honourable Court has been deceived. The interdict is not protecting legitimate business interests - it is protecting an ongoing criminal enterprise while forcing the victims to pay R100,000 per month from personal funds to keep the infrastructure running that the criminals are using to steal from us."

### The Five Urgent Reasons

**4.1 The Financial Emergency**
- We cannot sustain R100,000/month personal payments
- We receive ZERO revenue due to the hijacking
- Every day costs us R3,333 personally
- Bankruptcy looms while criminals profit

**4.2 The Ongoing Criminal Activity**
- Customer theft continues daily
- Evidence destruction ongoing
- New fraudulent transactions daily
- Criminal enterprise expanding operations

**4.3 The Evidence Being Destroyed**
- Audit trails deleted (confirmed May 22)
- Financial records being altered
- Customer databases being exported
- Years of evidence disappearing

**4.4 The Customer Harm**
- Customers redirected to fraudulent site
- Personal data in criminal hands
- Payment information compromised
- No way to warn them (interdict prevents it)

**4.5 The Legal Impossibility**
- Cannot investigate while locked out
- Cannot preserve evidence
- Cannot protect the businesses
- Cannot stop the bleeding

# SECTION 5: THE RELIEF REQUIRED

## Immediate Relief Needed

### 5.1 Set Aside the Interdict Immediately
> "The interdict must be set aside with immediate effect as it is:
> - Protecting criminals, not businesses
> - Causing irreparable financial harm (R100k/month)
> - Preventing investigation of criminal conduct
> - Enabling ongoing theft and fraud"

### 5.2 Expanded Forensic Investigation

**Scope must include:**
1. All Adderory/Luxure/Luxury Products Online transactions
2. All bank account changes by Rynette
3. All journal entries/write-offs by Rynette
4. Shopify audit trail destruction
5. Customer database theft
6. Domain hijacking scheme
7. Email/communication analysis

### 5.3 Preservation Orders

**Immediate freezing of:**
- All Adderory (Pty) Ltd accounts
- All Luxure (Pty) Ltd accounts  
- All Luxury Products Online (Pty) Ltd accounts
- All accounts controlled by Rynette Farrar
- All RegimA-related domains registered by Adderory

### 5.4 Criminal Prosecution Referral

**Charges to include:**
- Fraud (systematic and ongoing)
- Theft (customer databases, revenues)
- Racketeering (criminal enterprise)
- Cybercrime (unauthorized access, data theft)
- Competition Act violations
- Companies Act violations (non-director control)

### 5.5 Damages Claim Preparation

**Quantifiable damages:**
- Personal payments: R100,000/month ongoing
- Lost revenue: R[amount]/month
- Strategic Logistics destruction: R[amount]
- Business value destruction: R[amount]
- Criminal prosecution costs: TBD

# SECTION 6: THE DECEPTION OF THE COURT

## The Complete Narrative Reversal

### What the Court Was Told
> "The Applicant presented us as threats to the businesses who needed to be stopped through an urgent interdict."

### The Actual Truth
> "We are the victims of an ongoing criminal enterprise, personally hemorrhaging R100,000 per month to keep businesses running while receiving no revenue due to a systematic hijacking operation that the interdict is protecting."

### The Evidence of Deception

**Either:**
1. The Applicant was deceived by Rynette (no computer access)
2. The Applicant is complicit in the scheme

**But regardless:**
- The Court was not given truthful information
- The interdict is based on false premises
- The real criminals are being protected
- The real victims are being destroyed

---

# SECTION 7: THE URGENCY FACTORS

## Why This Cannot Wait

### Daily Harm Calculation
- Personal loss: R3,333/day
- Evidence destruction: Ongoing
- Customer theft: Active
- Criminal profit: Growing

### The Tipping Point
> "We estimate we can survive another [30-60] days of R100,000/month payments before personal bankruptcy. After that, the businesses collapse, the criminals win, and justice becomes impossible."

### The Public Interest
> "This is not a private business dispute. This is an ongoing criminal enterprise affecting:
> - Hundreds of customers
> - Multiple businesses
> - The integrity of the justice system
> - The rule of law in commercial matters"

# THE CLOSING ARGUMENT

> "This Honourable Court faces a simple choice: Continue protecting a criminal enterprise while its victims hemorrhage R100,000 per month from personal funds, or set aside the interdict immediately to allow justice to prevail. Every day of delay deepens the financial catastrophe and emboldens the criminals. We respectfully submit that justice delayed is not merely justice denied - in this case, it is active participation in our financial destruction."
