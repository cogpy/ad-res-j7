## STRATEGIC IMPACT

### Multiple Independent Legal Grounds Established

The verification confirms that the evidence supports **multiple independent grounds** for setting aside Peter's interdict:

1. **Material Non-Disclosure:** Interdict void ab initio due to fraud on court
2. **Gross Disproportionality:** 36:1 to 136:1 harm ratio violates proportionality
3. **Bad Faith/Clean Hands:** Peter created problems he complains about
4. **Lack of Urgency:** 68-day delay contradicts emergency claims
5. **Alternative Remedies:** Less restrictive means available

### Comprehensive Case Destruction

The evidence verification demonstrates systematic rebuttal capability:
- **Every major allegation** has documented counter-evidence
- **Peter's credibility** undermined by hypocrisy and misrepresentation
- **Daniel's competence** proven by exceptional financial performance
- **Business necessity** established for all challenged practices
