# Revenue Stream Hijacking by Rynette - Documentation & Evidence

## Overview

This folder contains comprehensive documentation demonstrating the viability and transparency of a POPIA compliant Shopify Platform integrated with synchronized Clear Audit Trails for Customer Communication. The goal is to contrast this transparent system with the currently opaque system where only Rynette has visibility and control over all business aspects on her personal computer without oversight or cross-checks.

## Primary Objective

**Court Order Reinstatement**: To support legal proceedings requesting the rightful reinstatement of Shopify Platforms to their healthy pre-hijacking state, and mandate the use of the regima.zone domain owned by RegimA instead of the suspect domain owned by Addarory (Rynette's son).

5. **Accountability**: Clear audit trails for all actions and decisions

## Legal Context
