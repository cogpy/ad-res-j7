## SUPPLEMENTARY AFFIDAVIT

I, the undersigned,

**JAX MITCHELL FARRAR**

do hereby make oath and state as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE

1.1 I am the First Respondent in this matter and a director of the Third to Sixth Respondents.

1.2 The facts contained herein are within my personal knowledge and are both true and correct unless otherwise stated or apparent from the context.

1.3 I bring this supplementary affidavit as a matter of extreme urgency to inform this Honourable Court of:
   - 1.3.1 The catastrophic financial hemorrhage of R100,000 per month being personally borne by the Second Respondent and myself;
   - 1.3.2 Evidence of a systematic criminal enterprise that has hijacked the Respondent companies;
   - 1.3.3 The urgent need to set aside the interdict which is protecting criminals while destroying us financially.

### 2. THE HIDDEN FINANCIAL CATASTROPHE

**2.1 The R100,000 Monthly Personal Hemorrhage**

2.1.1 Since the granting of the interdict, the Second Respondent and I have been personally paying approximately **R100,000 per month** from our personal funds to maintain critical business infrastructure.

2.1.2 These payments are necessary to prevent the complete collapse of decades-old business relationships and infrastructure, including:

| Service | Monthly Cost | Contract Duration | Relationship Length |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Shopify Enterprise (30+ stores) | R45,000 | Multi-year | 20 years |
| Microsoft Enterprise Suite | R15,000 | Multi-year | 15 years |
| Amazon Web Services | R20,000 | Annual | 10 years |
| Domain and Hosting Services | R5,000 | Annual | 20 years |
| Other Critical Infrastructure | R15,000 | Various | Various |
| **TOTAL MONTHLY COST** | **R100,000** | | |

2.1.3 I attach hereto marked **"JF1"** copies of:
   - Personal bank statements showing these payments
   - The multi-year contracts requiring these payments
   - Proof that these are paid from personal, not company, accounts

**2.2 Zero Revenue Due to Criminal Hijacking**

2.2.1 While we pay R100,000 monthly from personal funds, we receive **ZERO revenue** from the companies due to a systematic hijacking of:
   - All payment processing systems
   - All customer databases
   - All online storefronts
   - All customer communications

2.2.2 I attach hereto marked **"JF2"** the company bank statements showing:
   - No revenue received since the interdict
   - Previous monthly revenue of R[amount]
   - The sudden cessation of all income

**2.3 The Daily Financial Impact**

2.3.1 Every day this interdict remains in force:
   - We personally lose R3,333
   - The criminal enterprise operates freely
   - Evidence is destroyed
   - Customers are defrauded

2.3.2 We estimate we can survive approximately 30-60 more days before personal bankruptcy forces us to cease payments, resulting in:
   - Loss of 20-year business relationships
   - Collapse of all infrastructure
   - Irreversible business destruction
   - Victory for the criminal enterprise

### 3. EVIDENCE OF THE CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE

**3.1 The Rynette Farrar Criminal Scheme**

3.1.1 We have discovered that Ms. Rynette Farrar, a non-director employed as bookkeeper, has orchestrated a systematic criminal enterprise involving:

**3.1.2 The Setup (April 2021)**
On three specific dates, companies were incorporated by her son:
- April 14, 2021: Luxury Products Online (Pty) Ltd
- April 29, 2021: Luxure (Pty) Ltd
- April 30, 2021: Adderory (Pty) Ltd

*Three companies in 16 days indicates premeditation.*

**3.1.3 The Infiltration (2021-2025)**
- Adderory became a supplier to RegimA companies
- Rynette processed and approved Adderory invoices (self-dealing)
- Competitors like Strategic Logistics were forced to sell below cost
- Millions in stock "disappeared" through journal entries

**3.1.4 The Hijacking (April-June 2025)**
- April 14: Rynette changed all bank accounts
- May 22: Destroyed Shopify audit trails for 30+ stores
- May 29: Adderory registered regimaskin.co.za domain
- June 20: All customers redirected to Adderory's website

3.1.5 I attach hereto marked **"JF3"** evidence of:
   - CIPC records showing company registrations
   - Bank change instructions signed by Rynette
   - WHOIS records showing Adderory owns regimaskin.co.za
   - Customer communications redirecting to the new site
   - Evidence of Shopify audit trail destruction

### 4. THE DECEPTION OF THIS COURT

**4.1 What This Court Was Told**

4.1.1 The Applicant presented us as threats to the businesses requiring urgent interdiction.

**4.2 The Hidden Truth**

4.2.1 We are the victims, personally funding the businesses at R100,000/month while:
   - Receiving no revenue
   - Being locked out of our own systems
   - Watching criminals operate freely
   - Unable to protect our customers

4.2.2 The interdict is not protecting businesses - it is protecting criminals while we hemorrhage money.

### 5. THE STRATEGIC LOGISTICS DESTRUCTION

5.1 Strategic Logistics CC, owned by the Second Respondent, has been systematically destroyed:
   - Forced to sell products below cost to RegimA
   - While Adderory sold identical products at inflated prices
   - Millions in delivered stock "written off" by Rynette
   - Company now technically insolvent

5.2 This demonstrates the pattern: destroy legitimate businesses while enriching the criminal enterprise.

### 6. WHY THE INTERDICT MUST BE SET ASIDE IMMEDIATELY

**6.1 We Cannot Continue the Financial Hemorrhage**

6.1.1 At R100,000 per month from personal funds with zero revenue, we face imminent financial ruin.

**6.2 The Criminal Enterprise Continues Daily**

6.2.1 Every day the interdict remains:
   - More customers are defrauded
   - More evidence is destroyed
   - More money is stolen
   - The criminals grow stronger

**6.3 We Cannot Protect the Businesses While Interdicted**

6.3.1 The interdict prevents us from:
   - Accessing our own systems
   - Warning customers of fraud
   - Preserving evidence
   - Stopping the theft

### 7. RELIEF SOUGHT

7.1 We respectfully seek:

**7.1.1 Immediate Setting Aside of the Interdict**
- To stop the R100,000/month hemorrhage
- To investigate the criminal enterprise
- To protect customers and businesses

**7.1.2 Expanded Forensic Investigation**
Including:
- All Adderory/Luxure transactions
- All Rynette Farrar activities
- All diverted revenues
- All destroyed evidence

**7.1.3 Preservation Orders**
- Freeze all Adderory/Luxure accounts
- Preserve all communications
- Prevent further domain transfers
- Stop customer database access

**7.1.4 Criminal Prosecution Referral**
- Fraud charges
- Theft charges
- Racketeering charges
- Cybercrime charges

### 8. CONCLUSION

8.1 This Honourable Court has been deceived. We are not the threat - we are the victims, hemorrhaging R100,000 monthly from personal funds while criminals protected by the interdict destroy our life's work.

8.2 Every day of delay deepens our financial catastrophe and emboldens the criminals. Justice delayed is our financial destruction.

8.3 We respectfully submit that the interdict must be set aside immediately to prevent irreparable harm and allow justice to prevail.

**WHEREFORE** I respectfully request that this Honourable Court grant the relief sought herein.
