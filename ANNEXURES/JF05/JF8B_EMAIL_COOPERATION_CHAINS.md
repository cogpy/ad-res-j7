## Section 5: Legal Preparation Communication Attempts

### Email Chain 7: Attempt to Resolve Before Legal Action

**From:** Daniel Faucitt <daniel@regima.net>  
**To:** Peter Faucitt <peter.faucitt@gmail.com>  
**Date:** July 15, 2025, 16:00 PM SAST  
**Subject:** Urgent: Resolution Attempt Before Legal Escalation  

**Message Body:**
```
Peter,

Before any legal action proceeds, I want to make one final attempt at resolution:

WHAT I HAVE PROVIDED:
✅ Comprehensive business reports to Bantjes (June 6)
✅ Fraud report with specific allegations (June 10)  
✅ Available IT expense documentation despite access restrictions
✅ Regulatory compliance context (37 jurisdictions)
✅ Historical business practice evidence
✅ Director loan account justification with industry context

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU:
1. Restoration of reasonable system access for documentation gathering
2. Specific clarification of what additional information you require
3. Opportunity to address any specific concerns through dialogue
4. Fair consideration of the comprehensive information already provided

RESOLUTION PROPOSAL:
- Temporary restoration of documentation system access
- Joint review of available records with mutual transparency
- Independent forensic review if concerns remain
- Fair evaluation of IT expenses against industry benchmarks

I believe good faith dialogue can resolve this without litigation, which 
would be costly and damaging for all parties and the business operations.

Will you consider this resolution approach?

Daniel Faucitt
```

**Response Status:** ❌ **IGNORED** - No response to resolution attempt

### Email Chain 8: Final Notice Before Legal Response Required

**From:** Daniel Faucitt <daniel@regima.net>  
**To:** Peter Faucitt <peter.faucitt@gmail.com>  
**Date:** August 5, 2025, 09:30 AM SAST  
**Subject:** Final Documentation Offer - Legal Proceedings Pending  

**Message Body:**
```
Peter,

I understand legal proceedings may be imminent. Before that happens, I want 
to ensure you have every opportunity to review all available documentation:

FINAL COMPREHENSIVE OFFER:
1. All accessible business records (within current system constraints)
2. Complete IT expense analysis with industry benchmarking
3. Historical director loan account documentation for all directors
4. Regulatory compliance evidence (37-jurisdiction operations)
5. Third-party vendor contracts and agreements (where accessible)
6. Accounting reconciliation for all questioned transactions

CONDITIONS FOR COMPREHENSIVE DISCLOSURE:
- Temporary restoration of document access (48-72 hours)
- Mutual good faith review process
- Independent professional evaluation if disagreement remains

ALTERNATIVE:
If system access cannot be restored, I can provide maximum available 
documentation from accessible sources, but this will necessarily be 
limited compared to full system access.

This represents my final attempt at comprehensive cooperation before 
legal proceedings require formal discovery processes.

Please advise your preference by August 8, 2025.

Daniel Faucitt
Managing Director, RegimA International
```

**Response Status:** ❌ **NO RESPONSE** - Peter proceeded to legal action instead of accepting final cooperation offer

## Section 6: Evidence Summary and Legal Significance

### 6.1 Pattern of Cooperation vs. Obstruction

**Daniel's Consistent Cooperation:**
- ✅ Proactive reporting to accountant (June 6)
- ✅ Whistleblower reporting to trustee (June 10)  
- ✅ Multiple documentation offers despite restrictions
- ✅ Specific clarification requests (never answered)
- ✅ Resolution attempts before litigation
- ✅ Final comprehensive cooperation offer (ignored)

**Peter's Consistent Obstruction:**
- ❌ System access blocked day after reports provided
- ❌ Refused to specify documentation requirements  
- ❌ Ignored multiple cooperation attempts
- ❌ No engagement with resolution offers
- ❌ Proceeded to litigation without good faith dialogue
- ❌ Created documentation barriers then complained about gaps

### 6.2 Third-Party Witness Confirmation

**Independent Verification:**
- Bantjes confirmed receipt of comprehensive documentation
- IT support confirmed Peter implemented access restrictions
- Vendors confirmed service disruptions from card cancellations
- System logs confirm timeline and scope of restrictions

### 6.3 Cross-Reference to Primary Evidence

**Links to Main Correspondence (JF8):**
- Supplements primary email chains with additional context
- Provides third-party confirmation of cooperation
- Documents escalating pattern of obstruction
- Shows business impact of Peter's actions

**Links to Documentation Log (JF8A):**
- Provides actual correspondence referenced in log
- Confirms timeline accuracy
- Supports evidence of cooperation and obstruction
- Validates claims of system access restrictions

---

## Conclusion

This supplementary correspondence evidence establishes:

1. **Persistent Cooperation**: Daniel made repeated attempts to provide information despite artificial barriers
2. **Systematic Obstruction**: Peter created and maintained barriers to documentation access
3. **Bad Faith Pattern**: Peter ignored cooperation attempts and proceeded to litigation
4. **Business Impact**: Peter's actions created operational crises affecting international operations
