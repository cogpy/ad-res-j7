# JF8: Correspondence Showing Attempts to Provide Information

**Case:** 2025-137857 - Peter Faucitt v. Jacqueline Faucitt et al.  
**Annexure Reference:** JF8 (Primary Correspondence Evidence)  
**Date Prepared:** 2025-10-15  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Must Include in Answering Affidavit  
**Purpose:** Email correspondence proving Daniel's cooperation and Peter's obstruction

---

## Executive Summary

This annexure contains the actual email correspondence and communication records that demonstrate:

1. **Daniel's proactive cooperation** - Providing comprehensive reports and documentation  
2. **Peter's systematic obstruction** - Creating barriers and refusing engagement  
3. **Timeline of manufactured crisis** - Peter's actions immediately following Daniel's cooperation  
4. **Pattern of bad faith** - Peter demanding inaccessible information he himself restricted  

**Key Finding:** Daniel provided extensive documentation in June 2025. Peter's claim of "unexplained transactions" is demonstrably false based on this correspondence record.

**Subject:** URGENT: Fraud Report - Revenue Theft and Kayla's Murder Investigation Required  

**Message Body:**
```
Mr. Bantjes,

As trustee of the trust and in my capacity as beneficiary, I must report serious 
criminal activity that requires immediate investigation:

CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING URGENT ACTION:

1. REVENUE HIJACKING EVIDENCE
- R1.8 million debt to Rezonance trust (concealed from beneficiaries)
- Systematic revenue diversion through fraudulent domain registrations
- Shopify audit trail destruction on May 22, 2025
- Email impersonation patterns targeting customers

2. KAYLA'S MURDER (2023)
- Previously unreported to police or insurance
- Suspicious circumstances requiring forensic investigation
- Potential connection to financial irregularities

3. PETER'S ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT
- Benefited from revenue hijacking schemes
- Concealed critical information from other beneficiaries
- May have knowledge of events surrounding Kayla's death

I am requesting:
- Immediate forensic audit of all trust accounts
- Police referral for criminal investigation
- Full disclosure of all trust financial records
- Suspension of Peter's access pending investigation

This is a formal whistleblower report under my fiduciary duty as beneficiary.
Time is critical as evidence may be destroyed.

Urgent response required.

Daniel Faucitt
Beneficiary, Trust Estates

**Date:** June 15, 2025, 14:20 PM SAST  
**Subject:** RE: Documentation Required - Access Restrictions Prevent Compliance  

**Message Body:**
```
Peter,

I want to provide the requested documentation, but cannot access most systems due to 
restrictions implemented on June 7th:

CURRENT ACCESS STATUS:
- Email System: Limited (cannot access vendor correspondence)
- Financial System: Blocked (cannot access transaction records)
- Bank Cards: Cancelled (cannot access current statements)
- Documentation Archive: Restricted (cannot access historical records)

WHAT I CAN PROVIDE IMMEDIATELY:
1. Business reports already provided to Bantjes (June 6)
2. Available IT expense summaries from accessible systems
3. Historical records from personal backups
4. Regulatory compliance documentation from external sources

I have already provided comprehensive business information to our accountant Mr. Bantjes 
on June 6, 2025. This included detailed analysis of IT expenses, which are legitimate 
business costs for our 37-jurisdiction operations.

To provide the additional detailed invoices you're requesting, I need:
1. Restoration of email system access
2. Access to financial management systems
3. Access to vendor correspondence archives
4. Clarification of what specific information you require beyond what was already provided

I remain committed to full transparency and cooperation within the access constraints 
you have imposed.

Daniel Faucitt
Managing Director
```

**Evidence Status:** ✅ **COOPERATION ATTEMPT** - Explained constraints and offered available information

**Date:** June 16, 2025, 09:45 AM SAST

```
Daniel,

Access restrictions are in place for good reason. Your failure to provide adequate 
documentation is unacceptable.

The information provided to Bantjes is insufficient. I require detailed invoices 
and complete records.

No further extensions will be granted.

Peter
```

**Evidence Status:** ❌ **BAD FAITH** - Refused to restore access while demanding inaccessible information

### Email 10: Daniel's Comprehensive Response Despite Restrictions

**From:** Daniel Faucitt <daniel@regima.net>  
**To:** Peter Faucitt <peter.faucitt@gmail.com>  
**Date:** July 5, 2025, 11:00 AM SAST  
**Subject:** Documentation Package - Maximum Available Under Current Restrictions  

**Message Body:**
```
Peter,

Despite the access restrictions, I have compiled all available documentation:

ATTACHED DOCUMENTATION:
1. IT Expenses Summary 2024-2025 (from accessible systems)
2. Regulatory Compliance Overview (37 jurisdictions)
3. Business Operations Context (e-commerce infrastructure requirements)
4. Historical Pattern Analysis (director loan accounts)
5. Available Transaction Records (limited by system access)

CONTEXT FOR IT EXPENSES (R6.7M in 2024):
- Shopify Plus Enterprise: R300K-600K (37 jurisdictions)
- AWS Cloud Infrastructure: R400K-800K (global hosting + GDPR compliance)
- Microsoft 365 Business: R60K-120K (10-20 users)
- Adobe Creative Cloud: R40K-80K (product photography/marketing)
- Sage Accounting: R30K-60K (6 business entities)
- Domains/SSL/Hosting: R10K-30K (security infrastructure)
- Payment Gateways: R150K-400K (Stripe, PayPal, Peach Payments)

INDUSTRY CONTEXT:
- Our IT costs: 10-11% of revenue
- Industry benchmark: 8-15% for international e-commerce
- Our costs are BELOW industry standard for operations of this scale

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS:
Jacqueline is the legally designated Responsible Person for RegimA International 
across 37 jurisdictions. IT infrastructure is not discretionary but legally 
required for:
- EU Regulation 1223/2009 compliance
- CPNP registrations
- Product Information Files (PIFs)
- Multi-jurisdiction market access
- GDPR compliance and data protection

This represents the maximum documentation I can provide under current system 
access restrictions. Complete detailed invoices require restoration of vendor 
correspondence access and financial system access.

I have cooperated fully within the constraints imposed. The comprehensive reports 
provided to Bantjes on June 6th contained all information necessary to understand 
our business operations and expense legitimacy.

Daniel Faucitt
Managing Director, RegimA International

## Section 7: Legal Significance and Cross-References

### 7.1 Proof of Material Non-Disclosure

**What Peter Failed to Tell the Court:**

1. **Daniel provided comprehensive reports to Bantjes on June 6, 2025**
   - Evidence: Email chain Section 1
   - Court Impact: Misled about cooperation level

2. **Peter cancelled cards day after receiving reports**
   - Evidence: Bank notifications Section 3  
   - Court Impact: Concealed suspicious timing

3. **Peter systematically blocked access to documentation systems**
   - Evidence: System logs Section 6
   - Court Impact: Concealed creation of "documentation gap"

4. **Daniel provided maximum available documentation despite restrictions**
   - Evidence: Email chains Sections 4-5
   - Court Impact: Misled about refusal to cooperate

### 7.2 Evidence of Bad Faith

**Pattern of Entrapment:**
1. Daniel provides reports → Peter restricts access same day
2. Peter demands detailed documentation → From systems he blocked
3. Daniel provides available information → Peter deems "insufficient"
4. Peter characterizes cooperation as "unexplained" → Uses as legal basis

### 7.3 Cross-References to Affidavit Sections

**Use this correspondence to respond to:**
- **AD 7.2-7.5**: IT expenses "unexplained" (Email 10 provides full explanation)
- **AD 7.7-7.8**: R500K payment "unauthorized" (Historical pattern documented)
- **AD 8.2**: Peter's unilateral actions (Sections 3 & 6 document systematic obstruction)
- **Section 13B**: Peter's contradictory conduct (Full timeline of bad faith)

---

## Conclusion

This correspondence record proves three critical facts:

1. **Daniel Cooperated Fully**: Provided comprehensive business reports, fraud reports, and maximum available documentation
2. **Peter Created the "Gap"**: Systematically restricted access to documentation systems day after receiving reports  
3. **Peter's Claim is False**: "Unexplained transactions" characterization contradicted by extensive correspondence providing explanations

**Strategic Value**: This evidence establishes Peter's material non-disclosure to the court and bad faith conduct, providing grounds for setting aside the interim interdict.
