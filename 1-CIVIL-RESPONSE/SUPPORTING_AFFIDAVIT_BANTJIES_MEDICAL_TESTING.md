---

## PART B: THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST PROBLEM

### 2. WHO IS BANTJIES?

#### 2.1 Professional Background

2.1.1 **[Full Name]** (referred to as "Bantjies") is a Chartered Accountant.

2.1.2 Bantjies has served as accountant for RegimA entities for several years.

2.1.3 Bantjies is also a **Commissioner of Oaths**.

2.1.4 In **July 2024**, Bantjies was appointed as **trustee** of the [Trust Name] trust.

#### 2.2 Multiple Roles

2.2.1 Bantjies currently holds **four separate roles** that create dangerous conflicts:

**Role 1: Company Accountant**
- Prepares financial statements for RegimA entities
- Has access to all financial information
- Controls the financial narrative
- Advises on financial matters

**Role 2: Trustee**
- Controls trust distributions (including R18M payout)
- Owes fiduciary duty to beneficiaries
- Makes decisions about beneficiary capacity
- Determines distribution timing and amounts

**Role 3: Commissioner of Oaths**
- Can certify legal documents
- Can authenticate affidavits
- Can formalize medical testing arrangements
- Can certify implementation documents

**Role 4: Peter's Ally**
- Provides confirmatory affidavit supporting Peter's case
- Financial information to Peter flows through Bantjies
- Aligned with Peter's litigation strategy

#### 2.3 The Concentration of Power

2.3.1 These four roles create an unprecedented concentration of power:
- Bantjies controls the **financial narrative** (as accountant)
- Bantjies controls the **R18M distribution** (as trustee)
- Bantjies can **certify documents** (as Commissioner of Oaths)
- Bantjies is **aligned with Peter** (as ally providing confirmatory affidavit)

2.3.2 This concentration of roles creates **unacceptable manipulation risk**.

---

### 3. BANTJIES' FALSE CONFIRMATORY AFFIDAVIT

#### 3.1 What Bantjies Said

3.1.1 **Annexure JF-BANTJIES1** is Bantjies' confirmatory affidavit supporting Peter's interdict application.

3.1.2 In this affidavit, Bantjies confirms:
- [Specific false statements]
- [Additional misrepresentations]
- [Financial characterizations supporting Peter]

#### 3.2 What Bantjies' Own Financial Statements Show

3.2.1 **Annexure JF-BANTJIES2** contains financial statements **prepared by Bantjies himself**.

3.2.2 These statements **contradict** Bantjies' confirmatory affidavit:
- [Specific contradiction 1]
- [Specific contradiction 2]
- [Specific contradiction 3]

#### 3.3 Bantjies Provided False Confirmation

3.3.1 Bantjies' affidavit contradicts his own financial records.

3.3.2 This demonstrates:
- Willingness to misrepresent facts to support Peter
- Selective presentation of information
- Alignment with Peter's narrative over accuracy
- Cannot be trusted to act impartially

3.3.3 **Evidence**: Compare JF-BANTJIES1 (affidavit) with JF-BANTJIES2 (financial statements) - direct contradictions.

---

### 4. THE TRUST AND R18M PAYOUT

#### 4.1 Trust Structure

4.1.1 The [Trust Name] trust was established [date/purpose].

4.1.2 **Annexure JF-TRUST1** contains:
- Trust deed
- Bantjies' appointment as trustee (July 2024)
- Trust provisions regarding distributions

4.1.3 Beneficiaries include:
- Jacqueline Faucitt (me)
- Daniel James Faucitt (my son)
- [Other beneficiaries]

#### 4.2 The R18M Investment

4.2.1 The trust holds an investment with **R18 million payout** due **May 2026**.

4.2.2 **Annexure JF-INVESTMENT1** contains investment documentation showing:
- Investment principal and returns
- Payout date: May 2026
- Distribution provisions
- Beneficiary entitlements

4.2.3 This is a **major financial event** - nine months after the Interdict.

#### 4.3 Bantjies' Control Over Distribution

4.3.1 As trustee, Bantjies has **discretionary control** over:
- Timing of distributions
- Amounts distributed to each beneficiary
- Conditions imposed on distributions
- Withholding distributions based on "concerns"

4.3.2 The trust deed gives the trustee broad discretion.

4.3.3 Bantjies can effectively **control who gets what** from the R18M payout.

---

### 5. TIMING: THE SUSPICIOUS PATTERN

#### 5.1 Timeline of Bantjies' Involvement

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **July 2024** | Bantjies appointed trustee | Gains control over R18M distribution |
| **11 Aug 2025** | Settlement agreement (medical testing clause) | Positions for capacity evaluation |
| **13 Aug 2025** | Peter files Interdict (Bantjies provides affidavit) | Bantjies supports Peter's narrative |
| **19 Aug 2025** | Interdict granted | Control achieved over Jax and Daniel |
| **Oct 2025** | Medical testing scheduled | 7 months before R18M payout |
| **May 2026** | R18M payout due | Financial objective |

#### 5.2 The Pattern

5.2.1 All events position for control over R18M payout:
- Trustee appointment (July 2024): **Control mechanism**
- Medical testing (Oct 2025): **Incapacity findings**
- R18M payout (May 2026): **Financial objective**

5.2.2 The medical testing is scheduled **7 months before** the R18M payout.

5.2.3 This timing maximizes manipulation opportunity:
- Financial incentive is highest BEFORE payout
- Any incapacity finding gives Bantjies unfettered control
- Testing AFTER payout would eliminate manipulation motive

---

## PART C: THE MEDICAL TESTING MANIPULATION RISK

### 6. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT MANIPULATION

#### 6.1 How the Medical Testing Clause Was Changed

6.1.1 The settlement agreement signed on **11 August 2025** contains a medical testing clause.

6.1.2 **The clause was materially changed** between draft and final version:

**Draft Version** (reviewed by Dan & Jax):
- Parties control professional selection
- Direct input on testing scope
- Control over process

**Final Version** (signed):
- **Attorneys control selection**
- Testing scope determined by professionals selected by attorneys
- Parties lost control

6.1.3 When Daniel questioned "Has anything changed?", he was told "**No, just details for the attorneys**."

6.1.4 This was a **material misrepresentation** inducing signature.

#### 6.2 Evidence of the Change

6.2.1 **Annexure JF5-DRAFT**: Settlement agreement draft version showing party control.

6.2.2 **Annexure JF5-FINAL**: Settlement agreement final version showing attorney control.

6.2.3 **Annexure JF5-COMPARISON**: Side-by-side comparison highlighting material changes.

6.2.4 **Annexure DJF** (Daniel's witness statement): Documents the "Has anything changed?" exchange and misrepresentation.

#### 6.3 Why the Change Matters

6.3.1 With **party control**: Independent professional selection, balanced process.

6.3.2 With **attorney control**: Attorneys (aligned with Peter/Bantjies) select professionals, biased process.

6.3.3 The change enabled manipulation by:
- Transferring selection to Peter's team
- Removing Jax and Daniel's protective controls
- Creating potential for biased professional selection
- Enabling the manipulation scenario described below

---

### 7. THE MEDICAL TESTING MANIPULATION SCENARIO

#### 7.1 Scheduled Testing

7.1.1 Medical testing is scheduled for **October 2025**.

7.1.2 This is **7 months before** the R18M payout (May 2026).

7.1.3 The testing includes psychiatric/psychological evaluation.

#### 7.2 The Manipulation Sequence

**Step 1: Psychiatric Evaluation Conducted (October 2025)**

7.2.1 Psychiatrist/psychologist selected by Peter's attorneys (per manipulated settlement agreement).

7.2.2 Professional conducts evaluation of Dan and Jax.

**Step 2: Bantjies Provides "Financial Information" to Psychiatrist**

7.2.3 As accountant, Bantjies provides "professional opinion" on financial matters:
- "Unexplained" R8.8M IT expenses (omits 37-jurisdiction context)
- "Unauthorized" R500K payment (omits director loan account context)
- "Business losses" (omits that Interdict caused the losses)
- "Lack of documentation" (omits that Peter's card cancellations created the gap)
- "Irregular transactions" (omits established 20-year practice)

7.2.4 Bantjies presents **selective narrative** supporting Peter's claims.

**Step 3: Psychiatrist Relies on Bantjies' "Professional Opinion"**

7.2.5 Psychiatrist is not a financial expert.

7.2.6 Psychiatrist accepts Bantjies' characterizations as authoritative.

7.2.7 Bantjies is a Chartered Accountant - his opinion carries weight.

7.2.8 Psychiatrist is unaware of:
- Bantjies' false confirmatory affidavit
- Bantjies' conflict of interest as trustee
- Bantjies' financial incentive (controls R18M distribution)
- The full context omitted from Bantjies' narrative

**Step 4: Report Finds "Financial Mismanagement" or "Impaired Judgment"**

7.2.9 Based on Bantjies' misleading information, psychiatrist concludes:
- Dan and Jax show "poor financial judgment"
- "Inability to manage complex financial matters"
- "Concerns about decision-making capacity"

**Step 5: Report Recommends "Treatment" or "Curatorship"**

7.2.10 Psychiatric report recommends:
- Ongoing psychiatric treatment
- Financial oversight
- Possible curatorship
- "Protection" from financial decisions

**Step 6: Bantjies Certifies Implementation Documents**

7.2.11 As Commissioner of Oaths, Bantjies certifies:
- Documents implementing psychiatric recommendations
- Curatorship applications
- Treatment authorizations

7.2.12 Using his **third role** to formalize the manipulation.

**Step 7: Dan & Jax Restricted/Incapacitated**

7.2.13 Based on psychiatric findings, Dan and Jax are:
- Placed under curatorship
- Restricted from financial decisions
- Unable to challenge Bantjies' control
- Effectively silenced

**Step 8: Bantjies Distributes R18M as He Sees Fit (May 2026)**

7.2.14 With Dan and Jax incapacitated, Bantjies:
- Controls R18M distribution without oversight
- Makes decisions without beneficiary input
- No family challenge possible
- Distributes funds according to his interests (aligned with Peter)

#### 7.3 Why This Is Not Speculation

7.3.1 **This is not speculation** - it is the logical consequence of the existing role conflicts.

7.3.2 The components are already in place:
- Bantjies has trustee control (July 2024)
- Bantjies has shown willingness to misrepresent (false affidavit)
- Medical testing scheduled (Oct 2025, 7 months before payout)
- Bantjies controls financial narrative (as accountant)
- Bantjies can certify documents (as Commissioner of Oaths)
- Financial incentive is maximum (before R18M distribution)

7.3.3 **All that's required** is for the sequence to play out as designed.

7.3.4 The Court has a **duty** to prevent foreseeable manipulation, not wait for it to occur.

---

### 8. CUI BONO ANALYSIS: WHO BENEFITS?

#### 8.1 Who Benefits from the Interdict?

**NOT Peter:**
- Exposed to R110M+ in potential liability (regulatory non-compliance)
- No financial gain
- Company value destroyed
- Family relationships destroyed

**NOT the Companies:**
- R68M+ documented harm
- Ongoing revenue theft
- Business operations destroyed
- Regulatory violations multiplying

**NOT the Family:**
- Relationships destroyed
- Trust broken
- Financial losses accumulating
- Legal costs mounting

**ONLY Bantjies:**
- As trustee, controls R18M if we're incapacitated
- Benefits from our inability to challenge his decisions
- Financial manipulation incentive maximized before payout
- Can distribute R18M according to his interests

**ONLY Rynette:**
- Continues revenue theft undetected (R14.5M+)
- Evidence destruction protected
- Access to company systems maintained
- Criminal enterprise enabled

#### 8.2 The Evidence

8.2.1 **Annexure JF-CUI-BONO** contains detailed financial benefit analysis showing:
- Peter's net loss from Interdict (R110M+ exposure)
- Companies' losses (R68M+ harm)
- Bantjies' potential gain (control of R18M)
- Rynette's actual gain (R14.5M+ theft)

8.2.2 The numbers prove: **Bantjies is the only party who benefits**.

#### 8.3 Implications

8.3.1 The fact that Peter does not benefit from the Interdict demonstrates:
- Peter is being used by others (Bantjies, Rynette)
- The Interdict serves ulterior motives, not Peter's interests
- Financial manipulation by third parties, not family dispute
- Peter may not fully understand he's being manipulated

---

## PART D: THE R18M PAYOUT AT STAKE

### 9. INVESTMENT STRUCTURE

#### 9.1 Investment Details

9.1.1 The trust holds an investment currently valued at approximately **R18 million**.

9.1.2 **Annexure JF-INVESTMENT1** contains:
- Investment agreements
- Valuation documentation
- Payout schedule showing May 2026 date
- Distribution provisions

#### 9.2 Beneficiary Entitlements

9.2.1 Under the trust deed, beneficiaries are entitled to distributions.

9.2.2 Absent incapacity findings, beneficiaries would:
- Receive equitable distributions
- Have input on distribution decisions
- Exercise oversight over trustee
- Challenge improper trustee conduct

#### 9.3 Impact of Incapacity Findings

9.3.1 If Dan and Jax are found "incapacitated" based on manipulated medical testing:
- Lose oversight rights
- Cannot challenge Bantjies' decisions
- Cannot oppose distributions to Peter or others
- Effectively disinherited

9.3.2 Bantjies would have **unfettered control** over the R18M distribution.

---

### 10. TIMING IS EVERYTHING

#### 10.1 Why Testing Before Payout Is Dangerous

10.1.1 Testing scheduled **October 2025** = 7 months **before** R18M payout.

10.1.2 Financial manipulation incentive is **highest BEFORE payout**:
- Incapacity findings give control over distribution
- Bantjies decides who gets what
- No beneficiary oversight if we're incapacitated
- Maximum financial leverage

10.1.3 Testing **AFTER payout** would eliminate manipulation motive:
- Funds already distributed
- No control leverage remaining
- Incapacity findings have no financial impact
- Only 7-month delay (reasonable given conflicts)

#### 10.2 If Genuine Medical Concern (Not Financial Control)

10.2.1 If there is genuine medical concern (not financial control agenda):
- No legitimate reason testing must happen BEFORE payout
- 7-month delay is reasonable given conflicts
- Testing after payout eliminates conflict of interest
- Protects all parties from suspicion of manipulation

10.2.2 **Insistence** on testing BEFORE payout reveals true purpose:
- Not medical concern
- Financial control objective
- Positioning for R18M distribution manipulation

---

## PART E: TIMELINE ANALYSIS SHOWING COORDINATION

### 11. THE COMPREHENSIVE TIMELINE

#### 11.1 Phase 1: Positioning for Control (July 2024)

| Date | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **July 2024** | Bantjies appointed trustee | Establishes control mechanism over R18M |

**Analysis**: Control infrastructure created 10 months before payout.

#### 11.2 Phase 2: Settlement and Interdict (August 2025)

| Date | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **11 Aug 2025** | Settlement agreement signed | Medical testing clause (manipulated) |
| **13 Aug 2025** | Interdict filed (Bantjies provides affidavit) | Immediate control, supported by Bantjies |
| **19 Aug 2025** | Interdict granted | Control achieved |

**Analysis**: Settlement → 2 days → Interdict. Bantjies actively supports Peter's case.

#### 11.3 Phase 3: Medical Testing (October 2025)

| Date | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Oct 2025** | Medical testing scheduled | Positioning for incapacity findings |

**Analysis**: 7 months before R18M payout, maximum manipulation opportunity.

#### 11.4 Phase 4: Financial Objective (May 2026)

| Date | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **May 2026** | R18M payout due | Financial objective achieved |

**Analysis**: All prior events position for control over this distribution.

#### 11.5 The Pattern Is Clear

11.5.1 **Every event** positions for control over R18M payout:
- Trustee appointment: Control mechanism
- Interdict: Immediate operational control
- Medical testing: Incapacity findings
- R18M payout: Financial objective

11.5.2 This is **coordinated**, not coincidental.

11.5.3 The timing demonstrates **strategic planning**, not emergency response.

---

## PART F: RELIEF REQUIRED

### 12. IMMEDIATE TRUSTEE SAFEGUARDS

#### 12.1 Bantjies Must Be Suspended

12.1.1 The Court should **immediately suspend** Bantjies as trustee pending investigation.

12.1.2 Grounds for suspension:
- Conflict of interest (multiple incompatible roles)
- False confirmatory affidavit (demonstrated unreliability)
- Financial incentive to manipulate medical testing
- Alignment with Peter's litigation strategy
- Control over R18M distribution while medical testing scheduled

12.1.3 Suspension prevents:
- Ongoing manipulation risk
- Further conflict of interest
- Prejudgment of beneficiary capacity
- Financial control before investigation

#### 12.2 Independent Interim Trustee

12.2.1 The Court should appoint an **independent interim trustee**:
- No relationship with Peter, Bantjies, or any party
- No financial interest in outcome
- Professional trustee experience
- Fiduciary duty to beneficiaries only

12.2.2 Interim trustee responsibilities:
- Preserve R18M investment
- Monitor trust assets
- Prevent unauthorized distributions
- Report to Court on trust matters
- Prepare for May 2026 payout

#### 12.3 R18M Investment Preservation

12.3.1 The Court should order:
- R18M investment preserved in current form
- No changes to investment structure
- No early withdrawals or distributions
- Quarterly accounting to Court
- Beneficiary notification of all trust transactions

#### 12.4 Commissioner of Oaths Prohibition

12.4.1 Bantjies should be **prohibited** from serving as Commissioner of Oaths for any matters related to:
- This case
- Medical testing
- Trust administration
- Any documents affecting Dan or Jax

12.4.2 This prevents use of third role to formalize manipulation.

---

### 13. MEDICAL TESTING CONDITIONS

#### 13.1 Medical Testing CANNOT Proceed Under Current Conditions

13.1.1 **Medical testing CANNOT proceed while Bantjies holds conflicting roles.**

13.1.2 **Medical testing CANNOT proceed until AFTER May 2026 payout is finalized.**

13.1.3 Rationale:
- Testing before payout = maximum manipulation incentive
- Bantjies' conflicts create unacceptable bias risk
- Financial objectivity impossible while R18M undistributed
- Only 7-month delay (reasonable given stakes)

#### 13.2 If Testing Must Proceed (Only After Conditions Met)

**The following conditions are MANDATORY if any medical testing is to proceed:**

**(a) Remove ALL Conflicts of Interest:**

13.2.1 Bantjies removed as trustee **OR** complete recusal from all trust decisions.

13.2.2 Independent trustee appointed with no connections to any party.

13.2.3 Financial information verified by **independent forensic accountant** (not Bantjies).

13.2.4 Bantjies cannot serve as Commissioner of Oaths for any related matters.

**(b) Timing Protection:**

13.2.5 **No testing until AFTER May 2026 payout finalized and distributed**.

13.2.6 This eliminates financial manipulation motive entirely.

13.2.7 7-month delay is reasonable given:
- R18M at stake
- Demonstrated conflicts
- Bantjies' false affidavit
- Pattern of manipulation

**(c) Scope Limitations:**

13.2.8 **Party control** (NOT attorney control) over professional selection.

13.2.9 **One-time evaluation only** - no ongoing treatments or monitoring.

13.2.10 Reports provided **directly to parties** (not filtered through attorneys).

13.2.11 **No automatic consequences** - findings do not automatically trigger:
- Curatorship
- Financial restrictions
- Treatment mandates
- Distribution withholding

13.2.12 **Right to refuse** recommended treatments or interventions.

13.2.13 **Independent verification** of any significant findings by second professional.

**(d) Financial Independence:**

13.2.14 Testing costs from **neutral source** (not Bantjies-controlled accounts).

13.2.15 R18M distribution **cannot be conditioned** on testing compliance.

13.2.16 No financial leverage over testing participation or outcomes.

---

### 14. R18M PAYOUT PROTECTION

#### 14.1 Distribution Requirements

14.1.1 When R18M payout occurs (May 2026), distribution requires:
- **Independent trustee review** (not Bantjies)
- **Consent of ALL beneficiaries** (unless legally incapacitated by independent process)
- **Court oversight** if any disputes
- **Transparent accounting** to all beneficiaries

#### 14.2 Prohibitions

14.2.1 R18M distribution **cannot be**:
- Withheld based on medical testing non-compliance
- Conditioned on psychiatric treatment
- Subject to Bantjies' unilateral discretion
- Delayed for strategic reasons

#### 14.3 Bantjies Recusal

14.3.1 Bantjies must be **completely recused** from all R18M decisions:
- No input on distribution amounts
- No vote on distribution timing
- No discretion over conditions
- No involvement in decision-making

14.3.2 This protects against conflict of interest and manipulation.

---

### 15. FORENSIC INVESTIGATION OF BANTJIES

#### 15.1 Independent Review Required

15.1.1 The Court should order **independent forensic investigation** of Bantjies' conduct:

**As Trustee:**
- All trust transactions since July 2024 appointment
- All communications with Peter/Peter's attorneys
- All financial benefits received
- All decisions made affecting beneficiaries

**As Accountant:**
- All financial statements prepared for RegimA entities
- Comparison with underlying records (accuracy check)
- All communications with Rynette Farrar
- All advice given to Peter

**As Peter's Ally:**
- All involvement in Interdict application
- All information provided to Peter's attorneys
- All confirmatory statements made
- Financial benefit from Peter's success

#### 15.2 Specific Investigation Areas

15.2.1 **The false confirmatory affidavit**:
- What Bantjies said vs. what his own records show
- Why contradictions exist
- Whether Bantjies knew statements were false
- Impact on Court's decision

15.2.2 **Communications with Rynette**:
- Any coordination with revenue hijacking
- Any knowledge of theft
- Any benefit from Interdict protecting Rynette
- Any financial connections to Adderory entities

15.2.3 **Financial benefit from Interdict**:
- How Bantjies benefits from our incapacity
- R18M distribution scenarios with/without our input
- Cui bono analysis focused on Bantjies
- Quantification of financial incentive

#### 15.3 Report to Court

15.3.1 Forensic investigator should report to Court on:
- Conflicts of interest identified
- Financial improprieties found
- Recommendations for trustee removal/discipline
- Criminal referral if warranted

---

### 16. WHY THESE CONDITIONS ARE CRITICAL

#### 16.1 The Concentration of Roles Creates Unacceptable Risk

16.1.1 Bantjies controls:
- **Financial narrative** (as accountant)
- **R18M distribution** (as trustee)
- **Document certification** (as Commissioner of Oaths)
- **Information flow** (as Peter's ally)

16.1.2 This concentration enables:
- Complete manipulation of medical testing
- Unfettered control over R18M
- No effective oversight or challenge
- Financial abuse of beneficiaries

#### 16.2 Bantjies Has Demonstrated Unreliability

16.2.1 Bantjies already provided **false confirmatory affidavit** contradicting his own records.

16.2.2 This proves:
- Willingness to misrepresent for Peter's benefit
- Alignment with Peter over accuracy
- Cannot be trusted to act impartially
- Professional status does not guarantee ethical conduct

#### 16.3 If Genuine Medical Concern (Not Financial Control)

16.3.1 If there is genuine medical concern:
- **No legitimate reason** testing must happen before R18M payout
- **7-month delay** is reasonable given conflicts
- Testing **after payout** eliminates manipulation motive
- Protects all parties from suspicion

16.3.2 **Insistence** on testing **before payout** reveals true purpose:
- Not medical concern
- **Financial control** objective
- Positioning to control R18M distribution

#### 16.4 Court's Duty to Protect Beneficiaries

16.4.1 The Court has a **duty** to protect trust beneficiaries from:
- Trustee conflicts of interest
- Financial manipulation
- Abuse of fiduciary position
- Foreseeable harm

16.4.2 The conflicts here are **obvious and extreme**.

16.4.3 The Court must act **preventatively**, not wait for manipulation to occur.

16.4.4 Once R18M is distributed improperly, remedy may be impossible.

---

## PART G: INTEGRATION WITH MAIN APPLICATION

### 17. RELEVANCE TO RESCISSION APPLICATION

#### 17.1 Material Non-Disclosure

17.1.1 Peter failed to disclose:
- Bantjies' trustee role and conflicts
- R18M payout timing (9 months after Interdict)
- Medical testing manipulation risk
- Financial motive for Interdict timing

17.1.2 This supports Ground 1 of rescission application (material non-disclosure).

#### 17.2 Pattern of Strategic Timing

17.2.1 Timeline shows coordination:
- Trustee appointment → Settlement → Interdict → Medical testing → R18M payout
- All events position for financial control
- Strategic planning, not emergency response

17.2.2 This supports rescission by showing:
- False urgency claim
- Ulterior financial motive
- Abuse of process
- Bad faith application

#### 17.3 Cui Bono Proves Ulterior Motive

17.3.1 Peter does **not benefit** from Interdict (R110M+ exposure).

17.3.2 **Only Bantjies benefits** (control of R18M).

17.3.3 This proves:
- Interdict serves ulterior motive
- Not family dispute but financial manipulation
- Peter being used by others
- Abuse of process

---

### 19. CONCLUSION

- Medical testing scheduled 7 months before R18M payout (maximum manipulation opportunity)

- Pattern of coordination shows financial control objective

19.2 The Court has a duty to:
- Protect trust beneficiaries from foreseeable harm
- Prevent trustee conflicts of interest
- Ensure medical testing is not manipulated for financial control
- Preserve R18M investment for proper distribution

19.3 The requested relief is essential to:
- Remove unacceptable conflicts
- Prevent financial manipulation
- Protect beneficiaries' interests
- Ensure fairness and impartiality

19.4 Every condition is **necessary and proportionate** given the stakes (R18M) and demonstrated risks.
