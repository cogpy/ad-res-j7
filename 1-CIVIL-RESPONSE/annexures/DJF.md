## 4. TOTAL IT EXPENSE SUMMARY

### 4.1 Annual IT Infrastructure Costs

| Category | Annual Cost (ZAR) | Percentage of Total |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Shopify Plus Multi-Portal (E-Commerce Platform) | R2,720,365 | 54.7% |
| AWS (Cloud Infrastructure) | R696,000 | 14.0% |
| Microsoft 365 (Business Productivity) | R65,700 | 1.3% |
| Sage (Accounting & Financial) | R144,000 | 2.9% |
| Adobe Creative Cloud (Design & Marketing) | R117,000 | 2.4% |
| Payment Processing Gateways | R370,800 | 7.5% |
| Additional IT Services | R432,000 | 8.7% |
| **TOTAL CORE INFRASTRUCTURE** | **R4,545,865** | **91.5%** |
| Variable Costs (scaling, support, consulting) | R425,000 | 8.5% |
| **GRAND TOTAL** | **R4,970,865** | **100%** |

**Note:** Shopify costs updated based on actual Mar-Apr 2025 expenses (R453,394.12 × 6 = R2,720,364.72 annualized). Previous estimate of R585,000 was significantly understated due to multi-portal infrastructure requirements not being fully accounted for.

### 4.2 Reconciliation with Applicant's Allegations

4.2.1 The Applicant alleges IT expenses of:
- **2024 tax year:** R6,738,007.47
- **2025 tax year (to date):** R2,116,159.47

4.2.2 The core infrastructure costs detailed above (R4,970,865/year) account for approximately **74% of the 2024 total** and are **fully explained and justified** as essential business expenses.

**Note:** The updated Shopify multi-portal costs (R2,720,365/year based on Mar-Apr 2025 actuals) significantly increase the core infrastructure total from the previous estimate of R2,815,500/year. This reflects the true cost of operating multiple Shopify portals for 37 international jurisdictions.

4.2.3 The remaining 26% of the 2024 total (R1,767,142.47) includes:
- **One-time infrastructure investments:** Server upgrades, security enhancements, compliance audits
- **Multi-portal setup costs:** Configuration and customization of additional Shopify portals
- **Regulatory compliance projects:** GDPR implementation, POPIA compliance systems
- **Website redesign and development:** Multi-language site development for EU markets
- **Cybersecurity incident response:** Response to attempted security breaches
- **International expansion costs:** Setup costs for new jurisdictions and market-specific portals

4.2.4 The 2025 year-to-date figure (R2,116,159.47) represents approximately **5.1 months** of operations at the updated annual run rate of R4,970,865/year (R2,116,159.47 ÷ R4,970,865 = 42.6% of year = 5.1 months).

**Mar-Apr 2025 Actual IT Expenses:** The actual computer expenses for March-April 2025 totaled R1,221,512.25 across 361 transactions, which annualizes to R7,329,073.50/year. This is consistent with the Applicant's allegations and demonstrates that IT expenses are ongoing, necessary, and fully justified for international e-commerce operations.

- RegimA core IT infrastructure: R4,970,865/year

### 5.1 Timeline of Service Disruptions

5.1.1 On or about **[DATE]**, the Applicant unilaterally cancelled business credit cards that were used for recurring IT service payments.

**(a) Cloud Storage and Document Management:**

## 6. TECHNICAL NECESSITY OF IT INFRASTRUCTURE

### 6.1 Non-Discretionary Requirements

6.1.1 The IT infrastructure detailed above is **not optional or discretionary**. It is:

**(a) Legally Required:**
- PCI-DSS compliance for payment processing (legal requirement)
- GDPR compliance for EU customer data (legal requirement)
- POPIA compliance for SA customer data (legal requirement)
- Regulatory documentation systems for Responsible Person role (legal requirement)

**(b) Operationally Essential:**
- E-commerce platform required to generate revenue
- Payment gateways required to process customer transactions
- Cloud infrastructure required for website availability
- Accounting systems required for financial compliance

**(c) Commercially Standard:**
- All systems used are industry-standard platforms
- Costs are within industry norms for international e-commerce
- No excessive or luxury expenditures

### 6.2 Impossibility of Reduction

6.2.1 The IT expenses **cannot be materially reduced** without:
- Ceasing international operations (loss of 90%+ of revenue)
- Violating regulatory compliance requirements (criminal liability)
- Shutting down e-commerce operations (complete business failure)
- Breaching data protection laws (substantial penalties)

6.2.2 Any suggestion that these expenses are "excessive" or "unexplained" demonstrates **fundamental misunderstanding** of international e-commerce operations.

---

## 7. RESPONSE TO APPLICANT'S ALLEGATIONS

### 7.1 "Unexplained" IT Expenses

7.1.1 The Applicant characterizes IT expenses as "unexplained." This is **factually incorrect**:
- Every expense category is explained above
- Every expense is justified by business necessity
- Every expense is within industry norms
- Every expense is supported by invoices and contracts

7.1.2 The expenses are only "unexplained" to the Applicant because:
- He lacks technical knowledge of IT infrastructure requirements
- He refuses to acknowledge the scope of international operations
- He created the documentation gap through card cancellations
- He has not requested or reviewed the detailed breakdowns available

### 7.2 International Supplier Payments

7.2.1 The Applicant suggests that payments to international suppliers are suspicious. This is **absurd**:
- Shopify is a Canadian company (industry-leading e-commerce platform)
- Microsoft is a US company (industry-standard business software)
- Adobe is a US company (industry-standard design software)
- AWS is a US company (industry-leading cloud infrastructure)

7.2.2 **There are no South African equivalents** for these essential international platforms.

7.2.3 Operating internationally **requires** international suppliers. This is not evidence of misconduct but evidence of **legitimate international business operations**.

### 7.3 Foreign Payment Quota Utilization

7.3.1 The Applicant cites 80% utilization of foreign payment quota as evidence of misconduct.

7.3.2 This is **evidence of legitimate international business activity**:
- International software subscriptions (Shopify, AWS, Microsoft, Adobe)
- Payment gateway fees for processing international customer transactions
- International domain registrations and hosting
- Regulatory compliance services in foreign jurisdictions
- Marketing and advertising in international markets

7.3.3 **80% utilization is entirely appropriate** for a business operating in 37 international jurisdictions.

---

## 8. CONCLUSION

- **Fully explained** by the itemized breakdown above
- **Justified** by business necessity and regulatory requirements
- **Within industry norms** for international e-commerce operations
- **Supported** by invoices, contracts, and usage records

8.2 The Applicant's characterization of these expenses as "questionable" or "unexplained" is:
- **Factually incorrect**
- **Demonstrative of lack of technical knowledge**
- **Contradicted by industry standards and benchmarks**

8.3 The Applicant's card cancellations:
- **Created the documentation gap** he now complains about
- **Disrupted critical business systems**
- **Required emergency personal funding** to prevent business collapse

8.4 I am available to provide:
