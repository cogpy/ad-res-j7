**Identity Number:** 820715 5300 18 2  
**Occupation:** Chief Information Officer (CIO), Director  
**Address:** Suite 132, Nicol Hotel, Corner Nicol Road and Skeen Boulevard, Bedfordview, Gauteng  
**Date of Statement:** October 15, 2025

## DECLARATION

I, Daniel James Faucitt, do hereby make oath and state that:

1. I am an adult male and the Second Respondent in the above matter.

2. The facts contained in this statement are within my personal knowledge and belief, save where the context indicates otherwise, and are to the best of my knowledge and belief both true and correct.

3. Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.

---

## SECTION 1: BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

### 1.1 My Role and Responsibilities

4. I am the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of the RegimA Group of companies, primarily directing RegimA Skin Treatments (Pty) Ltd ("RST").

5. I am also a director of RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd ("RWW") and a member of Strategic Logistics Group CC ("SLG").

6. Through my UK company, RegimA Zone Ltd (which is independent of RegimA UK Ltd), I own and pay for the e-commerce Shopify platforms used by multiple entities, including:
   - RegimA Worldwide Distribution (South Africa)
   - RegimA Zone (South Africa)
   - RegimA SA (South Africa)
   - Other entities in the E-Commerce Automation Platform

7. I have been responsible for building and managing the IT infrastructure that has enabled the RegimA Group's international expansion to 37 jurisdictions and revenue growth from R2.1 million (2022) to R19.1 million (2024) - a 809% increase over three years.

---

### 1.2 Historical Relationship with Peter Faucitt

8. Peter Faucitt ("Peter") is my father and the Applicant in this matter.

9. For many years, Peter and I worked together in the family business. Peter had full access to all financial information through:
   - Annual financial statements prepared by the accountant, Daniel Jacobus Bantjes
   - Regular informal discussions about business operations
   - Access to the accountant for any queries or concerns
   - His role as trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust with absolute powers

10. Peter participated in the same informal director loan account practices that he now objects to. He made withdrawals from director loan accounts without board resolutions for years, just as all other directors did.

11. Peter was fully aware of the IT expenses and international operations for years. The financial statements showed IT expenses annually, and Peter never raised any objections until August 2025.

---

## SECTION 2: THE "HAS ANYTHING CHANGED?" EXCHANGE

### 2.1 Date and Context

12. In or around early June 2025, Peter approached me and asked: **"Has anything changed?"**

13. This question occurred after I had provided comprehensive business reports to the accountant, Daniel Jacobus Bantjes, on June 6, 2025, as part of routine tax season preparation.

14. The question also occurred shortly after Peter had secretly cancelled all business bank cards on or around June 7, 2025, without warning or discussion with me or my mother, Jacqueline Faucitt ("Jax").

---

### 2.2 The Question: "Has Anything Changed?"

15. Peter's question was: **"Has anything changed?"**

16. The tone and manner of Peter's question was **menacing and confrontational**, not genuinely inquisitive.

17. Peter's question was rhetorical - he already knew that nothing had changed in our business operations, financial arrangements, or IT infrastructure.

18. Peter had full knowledge of:
   - The director loan account practices (he participated in them himself)
   - The IT expenses (shown in financial statements for years)
   - The international operations (37 jurisdictions, ongoing for years)
   - The e-commerce platform structure (Shopify, AWS, etc.)
   - All financial arrangements (through accountant and financial statements)

19. Peter's question demonstrated that he knew nothing had changed, yet he was preparing to take drastic action based on alleged "new discoveries" of financial irregularities.

---

### 2.3 My Response

20. I responded to Peter's question by explaining that nothing had changed in our business operations.

21. I confirmed that:
   - Business operations continued as they had for years
   - IT infrastructure remained the same (necessary for 37-jurisdiction operations)
   - Director loan account practices continued as established
   - Financial arrangements remained consistent with historical practice

22. I was confused by Peter's question because nothing had changed, and Peter had full knowledge of all business arrangements for years.

23. I did not understand at the time that Peter was preparing to file an interdict based on alleged "new discoveries" of financial irregularities that he had known about for years.

---

### 2.4 Significance of the Exchange

24. Peter's question **"Has anything changed?"** is highly significant because it demonstrates:

   **a) Peter's Knowledge:** Peter knew that nothing had changed. He had full knowledge of all business arrangements for years.

   **b) Manufactured Urgency:** Peter's subsequent interdict (filed August 13, 2025) claimed urgent action was needed to address newly discovered financial irregularities. But Peter's own question demonstrates he knew nothing had changed.

   **c) Bad Faith:** Peter acknowledged that nothing had changed, yet proceeded to file an interdict claiming urgent new concerns. This demonstrates bad faith and manufactured justification.

   **d) Strategic Timing:** Peter's question occurred shortly after:
      - June 6, 2025: I provided comprehensive reports to Bantjes
      - June 7, 2025: Peter cancelled all business bank cards
      - This demonstrates Peter was preparing his interdict strategy, not reacting to new information.

25. Peter's question contradicts his founding affidavit allegations of "recently discovering" financial irregularities requiring urgent action.

---

## SECTION 3: EVENTS LEADING TO THE EXCHANGE

### 3.1 June 6, 2025: Comprehensive Reports to Bantjes

26. On June 6, 2025, I provided comprehensive business reports to the accountant, Daniel Jacobus Bantjes, as part of routine tax season preparation.

27. These reports included:
   - Complete business operations report
   - Financial summaries for all business entities
   - Transaction records for the review period
   - Operational context for tax preparation
   - Business structure documentation
   - Revenue and expense overviews

28. This was routine cooperation with the accountant during tax season. I provided all requested information for legitimate tax preparation purposes.

29. Peter was aware that I had provided these comprehensive reports to Bantjes, as Bantjes is Peter's personal accountant and Peter had full access to all information provided.

---

### 3.2 June 7, 2025: Card Cancellations

30. On or around June 7, 2025 (one day after I provided comprehensive reports to Bantjes), Peter secretly cancelled all business bank cards without warning or discussion.

31. The card cancellations caused:
   - Payment failures for critical cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft 365)
   - Service suspensions cutting off access to documentation systems
   - Operational chaos and business disruption
   - Loss of access to invoices, receipts, and records stored in cloud systems

32. Peter did not inform me or Jax of the card cancellations in advance. We only discovered them when payments began failing and services were suspended.

33. The timing of the card cancellations (one day after I provided comprehensive reports) demonstrates Peter's strategic intent to create operational chaos and then complain about lack of documentation.

---

### 3.3 June 10, 2025: Fraud Report to Bantjes

34. On June 10, 2025, I reported serious fraud and theft concerns to the trustee, Daniel Jacobus Bantjes.

35. I reported:
   - Evidence of revenue hijacking and theft
   - Kayla's murder in 2023 (previously unreported to authorities)
   - Peter's alleged involvement in financial irregularities
   - R1.8 million debt to Rezonance trust
   - Request for urgent forensic audit

36. Bantjes' response was dismissive: **"I am going away for 2 weeks."** He refused to investigate the serious allegations I reported.

37. Bantjes subsequently supported Peter's interdict application, demonstrating a conflict of interest and breach of his fiduciary duty as trustee.

---

## SECTION 3A: CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND TRUST OWNERSHIP CLARIFICATIONS

### 3A.1 The Corporate Structure: "NOT A GROUP"

37A. In my letters to Bantjies dated 6th June 2025 and 10th June 2025, I laid out the full structure of the business entities to provide clarity for tax preparation purposes.

37B. **Critical Clarification: These entities do NOT constitute a "group" in the legal sense.** There are no subsidiaries, no holding companies, and no consolidated group structure as might exist in a typical South African corporate group.

37C. Instead, the entities represent **four different ownership patterns** that can be designated as four associative groups based on ownership, not legal group structure:

**Pattern 1: Faucitt Family Trust Owned Entities**
- Villa Via Arcadia No 2 (Pty) Ltd (Third Respondent)
- RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (Fifth Respondent)

**Pattern 2: Direct Family Ownership**
- RegimA Skin Treatments CC (Fourth Respondent) - Various family member ownership

**Pattern 3: Strategic Partnerships**
- Strategic Logistics Group CC (Sixth Respondent) - Partnership structure

**Pattern 4: Independent Operating Entities**
- Various other trading entities with distinct ownership arrangements

37D. This distinction is crucial because Peter's interdict application treats these as if they were a unified group under single control, which misrepresents the actual ownership structure and governance requirements.

---

### 3A.2 Trust Ownership Correction: Villa Via Arcadia No 2 & RegimA Worldwide Distribution

38A. In my correspondence to Bantjies, I corrected a fundamental misunderstanding about ownership:

38B. **Villa Via Arcadia No 2 (Pty) Ltd** is owned by the **Faucitt Family Trust**, not by individuals.

38C. **RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd** is owned by the **Faucitt Family Trust**, not by individuals.

38D. This ownership structure through the trust has profound implications for Peter's claim that the interdict was necessary, as explained in the following sections.

---

### 3A.3 Faucitt Family Trust Powers: The Critical Asymmetry

39. The Faucitt Family Trust has the following beneficiary and trustee structure:

**Peter Faucitt's Roles and Powers:**
- **Founder** of the trust
- **Trustee** with decision-making authority
- **Beneficiary** with financial interest
- **Powers:** Unlimited and Absolute Powers over the trust and its assets

**Jacqui Faucitt's Roles and Powers:**
- **Beneficiary** with financial interest
- **Trustee** with co-decision-making authority
- **Powers:** Trustee powers, subject to trust deed provisions

**Daniel Faucitt's Roles and Powers:**
- **Beneficiary ONLY**
- **NO trustee powers**
- **NO decision-making authority**
- **NO right to respond to trust decisions**
- **NO right to know about trust affairs or decisions**
- **Powers:** NONE

40. This power structure means that in relation to Villa Via Arcadia No 2 (Pty) Ltd and RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd (the Third and Fifth Respondents):
   - Peter has absolute control through the trust
   - Daniel has no control whatsoever
   - Daniel cannot even respond to or be informed about decisions
   - Peter can act unilaterally to remove directors, change banking authorities, restructure management, or take any other action through the trust

---

### 3A.4 Why the Interdict Was Unnecessary: Peter's Existing Absolute Powers

41. Given Peter's Unlimited Absolute Powers as Founder, Trustee, and Beneficiary of the Faucitt Family Trust, the interdict was entirely unnecessary.

42. Peter already had the power to:
   - Remove directors from trust-owned companies (including me)
   - Change banking signatories and authorities
   - Appoint new directors or officers
   - Commission forensic audits through proper trust procedures
   - Restructure company management entirely
   - Control all financial decisions
   - Access all company records through trustee powers

43. Peter did NOT need court intervention because he already possessed absolute authority over the trust-owned entities.

44. **The critical question is: Why did Peter bypass his existing absolute powers and seek an ex parte interdict instead?**

45. The only logical explanations are:
   - **A. To avoid trust governance accountability:** Acting through the trust would require proper procedures and could be scrutinized by beneficiaries
   - **B. To create a public record of allegations:** The interdict creates a court record that damages my reputation
   - **C. To act immediately without proper process:** The ex parte procedure allowed Peter to act without notice or hearing
   - **D. To freeze assets ahead of financial events:** The May 2026 payout (see Section 3A.6) created urgency for control
   - **E. Because his claims would not survive scrutiny:** Proper trust procedures would expose the weakness of his allegations

46. Peter's choice to seek an ex parte interdict rather than use his existing absolute powers demonstrates this was about creating a manufactured crisis, not about addressing legitimate concerns.

---

### 3A.5 Bantjies' Secret Trustee Appointment: The Conflict of Interest

47. On 10th June 2025, in my letter to Bantjies reporting fraud, I believed I was reporting to the accountant who had access to Peter as the trustee.

48. I later discovered that **Daniel Jacobus Bantjies had been secretly appointed as a trustee of the Faucitt Family Trust in July 2024 by Rynette** (Peter's business administrator).

49. This meant that when I reported fraud concerns to Bantjies in June 2025:
   - Bantjies already had trustee powers and fiduciary duties to me as a beneficiary
   - Bantjies had a legal obligation to investigate my fraud reports
   - Bantjies had authority to conduct audits and oversight
   - Bantjies owed me duties of good faith, impartiality, and protection

50. Instead of investigating my reports, Bantjies:
   - Dismissed my urgent audit request with "I am going away for 2 weeks"
   - Failed to investigate despite identifying R10 million missing himself
   - Provided a supporting affidavit for Peter's ex parte interdict application
   - Supported action against me, the very beneficiary who reported fraud to him

51. **Bantjies' conduct constitutes a breach of his fiduciary duties as trustee.** He was obligated to investigate my reports, not to provide a supporting affidavit against me.

52. **Critical Question: How could Bantjies, as a trustee owing fiduciary duties to beneficiary Daniel, provide a supporting affidavit in Peter's interdict application AGAINST Daniel?**

53. The fact that Peter had Jacqui sign a document on 11 August 2025 (2 days before filing the interdict) making Peter the "main trustee" suggests:
   - Peter knew he needed to bypass Bantjies' trustee role
   - Peter was aware that Bantjies' position created complications
   - The timing of this "main trustee" appointment was coordinated with the interdict application
   - This demonstrates premeditation and manufactured process

---

### 3A.6 Bantjies' R18-Million Payout: The Financial Conflict of Interest

54. Bantjies has a significant financial conflict of interest that was not disclosed in his supporting affidavit.

55. Bantjies is due to receive a payout of approximately **R18-million in May 2026** from an investment that is maturing.

56. The timing of Peter's interdict (August 2025) is **9 months before this major payout**.

57. This creates a direct financial conflict for Bantjies:
   - His financial interests align with Peter's interests
   - He has a motive to support Peter's control of the businesses
   - He may benefit from Peter's control over trust assets
   - His objectivity as accountant and trustee is compromised

58. **The R18-million payout due in May 2026 explains:**
   - Why Peter needed to seize control in August 2025 (9 months before payout)
   - Why Bantjies supported Peter's application despite his trustee duties to me
   - Why proper trust procedures were bypassed (they would expose conflicts)
   - Why the interdict was filed 2 days after the settlement agreement

59. Bantjies failed to disclose this material conflict of interest in his supporting affidavit. This non-disclosure, combined with his breach of trustee duties, renders his affidavit unreliable.

---

### 3A.7 Rynette's Role: Who Was Really Instructing Whom?

60. Throughout the events leading to the interdict, a critical question emerges: **Was Peter actually being instructed by Bantjies, rather than Bantjies being instructed by Peter?**

61. Evidence suggests that Rynette Farrar (Peter's business administrator) was the primary coordinator:
   - Rynette appointed Bantjies as trustee in July 2024 (not Peter directly)
   - Rynette controlled Pete@regima.com (Peter's primary business email)
   - Rynette sent emails to clients redirecting payments in April 2025
   - Rynette's son's name was used for fraudulent domain registrations in May 2025
   - Rynette had access to all business systems and communications

62. **The question is: Was Rynette acting on Peter's instructions, or was Peter being manipulated by information provided by Rynette and Bantjies?**

63. Peter's **"Has anything changed?"** question (see Section 2) suggests he may have been uncertain about the actual state of affairs, despite claiming to have discovered financial irregularities.

64. If Rynette was coordinating with Bantjies rather than simply executing Peter's instructions, this would explain:
   - The sophisticated coordination of the interdict timing
   - The strategic card cancellations immediately after I provided reports to Bantjies
   - The manufactured crisis and documentation gaps
   - Bantjies' supporting affidavit despite his trustee conflicts
   - The R18-million payout motivation

65. This raises serious questions about whether Peter was acting independently or was being influenced/manipulated by parties with their own financial interests.

---

### 3A.8 Cross-Reference to AD Hypergraph Analysis

66. The complex relationships between:
   - Corporate ownership structures (4 associative patterns)
   - Trust powers and beneficiary rights
   - Bantjies' multiple conflicting roles (accountant, trustee, authority)
   - Rynette's coordinator role
   - The R18-million payout timeline
   - The interdict timing (2 days after settlement, 9 months before payout)

67. These relationships form an interconnected web that can be analyzed through the AD (Answering Affidavit) hypergraph cross-reference system maintained in this repository.

68. Key cross-references for this analysis:
   - **JF-TRUST-DEED:** Faucitt Family Trust deed showing Peter's unlimited powers
   - **JF-DAN-BENEFICIARY:** Trust provisions showing Daniel's limited status (beneficiary only, no powers)
   - **JF-BANTJIES-TRUSTEE-JUL2024:** Evidence of Bantjies' trustee appointment in July 2024
   - **JF-BANTJIES-AUTHORITY-OCT2024:** Bantjies' authority appointment documentation
   - **JF-MAIN-TRUSTEE-11AUG2025:** Document making Peter "main trustee" 2 days before interdict
   - **JF-REPORTS-TO-BANTJES:** My comprehensive reports to Bantjies on 6 June 2025
   - **JF-BANTJIES-FRAUD-EMAIL-10JUN:** My fraud report to Bantjies on 10 June 2025
   - **JF-BANTJIES-R10M-FINDING:** Bantjies' own identification of R10 million missing
   - **JF-INVESTMENT-PAYOUT-ANALYSIS:** Details of May 2026 R18-million payout
   - **JF-RYNETTE-EMAIL-CONTROL:** Evidence of Rynette controlling Pete@regima.com
   - **JF-CORPORATE-STRUCTURE:** Documentation of "NOT A GROUP" ownership patterns

69. These interconnections demonstrate that Peter's interdict was not a spontaneous response to newly discovered irregularities, but rather a carefully coordinated action with multiple financial and strategic motivations.

---

## SECTION 4: EVENTS FOLLOWING THE EXCHANGE

### 4.1 June-July 2025: System Restrictions

70. During June and July 2025, Peter progressively restricted my access to business systems, including:
   - Banking systems
   - Accounting software
   - Email systems
   - Cloud storage
   - E-commerce platforms

71. These restrictions prevented me from retrieving historical records and documentation that Peter was simultaneously demanding.

72. Peter created a documentation gap through his own actions (card cancellations and system restrictions), then complained about lack of documentation.

---

### 4.2 August 13, 2025: Ex Parte Interdict Application

73. On August 13, 2025, Peter filed an ex parte application for an interdict, claiming:
   - "Recently discovered" financial irregularities
   - Urgent action needed to prevent ongoing harm
   - Lack of documentation and transparency
   - Unauthorized IT expenses and director loan withdrawals

74. Peter's allegations contradicted his own **"Has anything changed?"** question, which demonstrated he knew nothing had changed.

75. Peter waited 68 days between his alleged "discovery" of irregularities and filing the interdict, contradicting his claims of urgency.

76. The timing of Peter's interdict was strategic:
   - Filed 8 days after a settlement agreement (August 5, 2025)
   - Coordinated with investment payout timeline (9-month window)
   - Designed to create leverage in settlement negotiations

---

### 4.3 August 19, 2025: Interdict Granted

77. On August 19, 2025, the Court granted Peter's interdict ex parte, without hearing from me or Jax.

78. The interdict blocked all system access, completing the obstruction that Peter began in June with card cancellations and system restrictions.

79. The interdict caused catastrophic harm:
   - R18M+ financial losses
   - R50M+ regulatory exposure (Jax's Responsible Person duties blocked)
   - Business operations destroyed
   - Vendor and customer relationships damaged
   - Criminal liability exposure for Jax (37 jurisdictions)

80. Peter failed to disclose to the Court:
   - Jax's Responsible Person role (37 jurisdictions)
   - The disproportionate harm the interdict would cause
   - His own conduct creating the problems he complained about
   - His existing powers as trustee to address concerns
   - The **"Has anything changed?"** exchange demonstrating his knowledge

---

## SECTION 5: PETER'S PATTERN OF BAD FAITH

### 5.1 Knowledge vs. Claims

81. Peter had full knowledge of all business arrangements for years:
   - Financial statements showed IT expenses annually
   - Peter participated in director loan account practices himself
   - Peter had access to all financial information through Bantjes
   - Peter's **"Has anything changed?"** question demonstrated his knowledge

82. Yet Peter claimed in his founding affidavit:
   - "Recently discovered" financial irregularities
   - Urgent action needed to address new concerns
   - Lack of transparency and documentation
   - Unauthorized expenses and withdrawals

83. Peter's claims are contradicted by his own conduct and the **"Has anything changed?"** exchange.

---

### 5.2 Creating Problems, Then Complaining

84. Peter created the problems he complained about:

   **a) Documentation Gap:**
   - Peter cancelled cards → Service suspensions → Loss of access to documentation
   - Peter restricted system access → Cannot retrieve records
   - Peter then complained about lack of documentation

   **b) Operational Chaos:**
   - Peter's card cancellations caused payment failures
   - Peter's system restrictions prevented normal operations
   - Peter then complained about business disruption

   **c) Communication Breakdown:**
   - Peter refused to respond to emails
   - Peter avoided meetings and discussions
   - Peter then complained about lack of cooperation

85. Peter's pattern demonstrates deliberate creation of problems to manufacture justification for the interdict.

---

### 5.3 Strategic Timing

86. Peter's timing demonstrates strategic calculation, not reactive urgency:

   **Timeline:**
   - June 6: I provide comprehensive reports to Bantjes
   - June 7: Peter cancels cards (one day later)
   - June 10: I report fraud concerns to Bantjes
   - June-July: Peter restricts system access
   - August 5: Settlement agreement signed
   - August 13: Peter files interdict (8 days after settlement, 68 days after alleged "discovery")
   - August 19: Interdict granted

87. The timing demonstrates:
   - Peter waited for strategic moment (after settlement)
   - Peter created problems (card cancellations, system restrictions)
   - Peter manufactured justification (documentation gap, operational chaos)
   - Peter used interdict for leverage (settlement negotiations)

---

## SECTION 6: IMPACT OF PETER'S CONDUCT

### 6.1 Personal Impact

88. Peter's conduct has caused me severe personal harm:
   - Loss of livelihood (cannot work due to interdict)
   - Reputational damage (allegations of financial misconduct)
   - Emotional distress (family conflict and legal proceedings)
   - Financial losses (legal costs, lost income)

89. The **"Has anything changed?"** exchange was particularly distressing because it demonstrated Peter's bad faith. He knew nothing had changed, yet proceeded to destroy the business and my livelihood based on manufactured allegations.

---

### 6.2 Impact on Jax

90. Peter's conduct has caused severe harm to my mother, Jax:
   - Criminal liability exposure (R50M+ as Responsible Person)
   - Regulatory crisis (37 jurisdictions)
   - Business destruction (R18M+ financial losses)
   - Reputational damage
   - Emotional distress

91. Peter failed to disclose Jax's Responsible Person role to the Court in his ex parte application. If the Court had known about Jax's legal obligations and the catastrophic harm the interdict would cause, the interdict would not have been granted.

---

### 6.3 Impact on Business

92. Peter's conduct has destroyed the business that took years to build:
   - Revenue growth from R2.1M (2022) to R19.1M (2024) - 809% increase
   - International expansion to 37 jurisdictions
   - Vendor and customer relationships built over years
   - IT infrastructure investment enabling operations

93. The business was profitable and compliant before Peter's interference. Peter's conduct has caused the business disruption he now cites as justification for the interdict.

---

## SECTION 7: CONCLUSION

### 7.1 Summary of Key Points

94. The **"Has anything changed?"** exchange is critical evidence demonstrating:
   - Peter's knowledge that nothing had changed
   - Peter's manufactured urgency and false allegations
   - Peter's bad faith throughout
   - Peter's strategic timing and leverage motive

95. The corporate structure analysis (Section 3A) reveals that:
   - The entities are "NOT A GROUP" but rather four distinct ownership patterns
   - Peter already had Unlimited Absolute Powers through the Faucitt Family Trust
   - The interdict was unnecessary given Peter's existing powers
   - Peter's choice to bypass trust procedures demonstrates bad faith

96. Bantjies' conflicting roles demonstrate:
   - Breach of fiduciary duty (as trustee owing duties to me as beneficiary)
   - Financial conflict of interest (R18-million payout in May 2026)
   - Material non-disclosures in his supporting affidavit
   - Coordination with Peter despite trustee obligations

97. Peter's conduct demonstrates a pattern of:
   - Creating problems, then complaining about them
   - Manufacturing justification for the interdict
   - Strategic timing for leverage in settlement negotiations
   - Material non-disclosure to the Court
   - Bypassing available trust remedies to avoid scrutiny

98. Peter's allegations are contradicted by:
   - His own **"Has anything changed?"** question
   - His participation in the same practices for years
   - His access to all financial information for years
   - His 68-day delay before filing interdict
   - His existing absolute powers through the trust

---

### 7.2 Relief Sought

99. Based on the facts set out in this statement, I respectfully submit that:
   - The interdict should be set aside (based on Peter's bad faith and material non-disclosure)
   - Peter's allegations are false and manufactured
   - Peter created the problems he complains about
   - The **"Has anything changed?"** exchange demonstrates Peter's knowledge and bad faith
   - Peter had existing absolute powers through the trust and did not need the interdict
   - Bantjies breached his fiduciary duties and failed to disclose material conflicts

100. I am available to give oral evidence and to be cross-examined on this statement if required by the Court.
