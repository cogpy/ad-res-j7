---

## Draft Affidavit Text

### Section [X]: Peter's Causation - Clean Hands Doctrine

**[X].1** I respectfully submit that the Applicant cannot rely on problems that he himself created through his own unilateral actions. This defense is grounded in the equitable doctrine of "clean hands" - a party seeking equitable relief must approach the court with clean hands.

**[X].2** The Applicant's founding affidavit alleges various deficiencies in documentation and transparency. However, a careful analysis of the timeline reveals that **the Applicant himself caused these alleged deficiencies** through deliberate obstruction and sabotage.

**[X].3** I set out below four categories of problems the Applicant complains about, and demonstrate in each case that the Applicant's own conduct directly caused the problem.

---

### Problem 1: Documentation Gap for IT Expenses

**[X].4** The Applicant alleges that IT expenses totaling R6,738,007.47 (2024 tax year) and R2,116,159.47 (2025 tax year) are "unexplained" and lack adequate documentation.

**[X].5** This allegation is demonstrably false. The documentation gap exists solely because of the Applicant's own actions, as follows:

**[X].5.1** On or about **June 6, 2025**, the Second Respondent (Daniel Faucitt) provided comprehensive business reports to the accountant and trustee, Mr. Daniel Jacobus Bantjes, for tax season preparation. These reports included detailed financial summaries for all business entities, transaction records, and operational context.

> **Evidence:** Annexure **JF-BANTJIES-REPORTS-06JUN** - Email from Daniel to Bantjes with comprehensive reports attached.

**[X].5.2** On or about **June 7, 2025** (the day after receiving these comprehensive reports), the Applicant **secretly cancelled all business bank cards** without warning to the Second Respondent or other operational staff.

> **Evidence:** Annexure **JF-CANCEL-DATE** - Documentation of card cancellation date and lack of prior notice.

**[X].5.3** The immediate effect of this card cancellation was payment failures for critical cloud-based services including:
- Cloud storage systems (AWS, Google Cloud) containing invoices and documentation
- Accounting software (Sage) containing financial records
- Email systems (Microsoft 365) containing correspondence and receipts
- Domain and hosting services containing website and transaction records

**[X].5.4** These payment failures resulted in service suspensions and loss of access to the very documentation systems that contained the IT expense records.

**[X].5.5** During June-July 2025, the Applicant further **restricted the Second Respondent's system access**, preventing retrieval of historical records from the systems that remained accessible.

> **Evidence:** Annexure **JF-SAL1** - System access restriction logs showing the Applicant excluded the Second Respondent from documentation systems.

**[X].5.6** Having created this documentation gap through his own actions, the Applicant then demanded detailed IT expense documentation that his own conduct had made inaccessible.

**[X].5.7** On **August 19, 2025**, the Applicant obtained an ex parte interdict that further prevented all system access, completing the obstruction he had begun in June.

**Causation Chain - Documentation Gap:**
1. Applicant's Action: Cancelled business credit cards (June 7, 2025)
2. Direct Result: Payment failures → Service suspensions → Loss of access to cloud documentation
3. Applicant's Action: Restricted system access (June-July 2025)
4. Direct Result: Cannot retrieve historical records from remaining systems
5. Applicant's Action: Obtained interdict blocking all access (August 19, 2025)
6. Direct Result: Complete inability to access documentation
7. Applicant's Complaint: "Lack of documentation for IT expenses"

**[X].5.8** The Applicant cannot rely on a documentation gap that he himself created. This violates the fundamental principle that a party seeking equitable relief must come to court with "clean hands."

**[X].5.9** Moreover, the characterization of IT expenses as "unexplained" is false. The expenses are fully explained in:
- The Second Respondent's technical affidavit (Annexure **DJF**)
- The IT spend industry comparative analysis (Annexure **JF-IT-COMP**)
- The comprehensive reports provided to Mr. Bantjes on June 6, 2025 (before the Applicant's sabotage)

---

### Problem 2: System Access and Record Retrieval

**[X].6** The Applicant alleges insufficient explanation and detail regarding business expenses and transactions.

**[X].7** This alleged deficiency is entirely the result of the Applicant's deliberate restriction of system access, as follows:

**[X].7.1** Throughout June and July 2025, the Applicant systematically restricted the Second Respondent's access to business systems including:
- Financial systems (Sage accounting software)
- Email systems (Microsoft 365 business email)
- Banking systems (FNB and ABSA online banking)
- Cloud storage systems (AWS, Google Drive)
- E-commerce platforms (Shopify)

**[X].7.2** These restrictions prevented the Second Respondent from retrieving the detailed records and explanations the Applicant now claims are missing.

**[X].7.3** The Applicant's conduct constitutes entrapment: he blocked access to the information, then complained about the lack of information.

**Causation Chain - System Access:**
1. Applicant's Action: Restricted system credentials and access (June-July 2025)
2. Direct Result: Second Respondent cannot retrieve historical records
3. Applicant's Action: Demanded detailed explanations and records
4. Direct Result: Second Respondent cannot provide what Applicant made inaccessible
5. Applicant's Complaint: "Insufficient explanation of expenses"

**[X].7.4** Had the Applicant not restricted system access, the Second Respondent could have provided any level of detail requested. The Applicant deliberately prevented this, then used the resulting gap as justification for the interdict.

---

### Problem 3: Communication Breakdown and Lack of Cooperation

**[X].8** The Applicant alleges a lack of transparency and cooperation from the Respondents.

**[X].9** This allegation is contradicted by the documentary evidence and is, in fact, a projection of the Applicant's own conduct onto the Respondents.

**[X].9.1** On **June 6, 2025**, the Second Respondent provided comprehensive reports to the accountant Mr. Bantjes, demonstrating full cooperation with legitimate oversight.

> **Evidence:** Annexure **JF8A** - Detailed log of all documentation provided to the Applicant or his representatives.

**[X].9.2** On **June 10, 2025**, the Second Respondent reported serious fraud and theft concerns to Mr. Bantjes, fulfilling his duty as a beneficiary to report concerns to the trustee.

> **Evidence:** Annexure **JF-DAN-FRAUD-REPORT-10JUN** - Email from Second Respondent to Bantjes reporting fraud concerns.

**[X].9.3** Mr. Bantjes dismissed these concerns with the response "I am going away for 2 weeks," refusing to investigate despite the seriousness of the allegations.

> **Evidence:** Annexure **JF-BANTJIES-HOLIDAY-RESPONSE** - Bantjes' dismissive response.

**[X].9.4** Throughout June and July 2025, the Second Respondent attempted to engage with the Applicant and provide explanations, but the Applicant:
- Refused to respond to emails
- Avoided meetings and discussions
- Ignored cooperation attempts
- Proceeded unilaterally without engagement

> **Evidence:** Annexure **JF8** - Correspondence showing attempts to provide information and the Applicant's non-response.

**[X].9.5** Having refused to engage with explanations offered, the Applicant then complained about a lack of transparency.

**Causation Chain - Communication Breakdown:**
1. Second Respondent's Action: Provided comprehensive reports (June 6, 2025)
2. Applicant's Response: Cancelled cards the next day (June 7, 2025)
3. Second Respondent's Action: Reported fraud concerns (June 10, 2025)
4. Applicant's Response: Trustee dismissed concerns, refused to investigate
5. Second Respondent's Action: Attempted to engage and provide explanations (June-July 2025)
6. Applicant's Response: Refused to respond, ignored cooperation attempts
7. Applicant's Complaint: "Lack of transparency and cooperation"

**[X].9.6** The Applicant cannot complain about a lack of cooperation when he himself refused the cooperation offered.

---

### Problem 4: Business Disruption and Financial Harm

**[X].10** The Applicant alleges business mismanagement and financial irregularities requiring urgent intervention.

**[X].11** The irony is profound: the business disruption the Applicant now cites as justification for the interdict was **caused by the interdict itself** and the Applicant's preceding actions.

**[X].11.1** Prior to the Applicant's June 2025 card cancellations and August 2025 interdict, the businesses were:
- Profitable and growing (revenue: R2.1M (2022) → R12.3M (2023) → R19.1M (2024))
- Compliant with all regulatory requirements
- Operating successfully across 37 international jurisdictions
- Fulfilling all obligations as Responsible Person under EU Regulation 1223/2009

**[X].11.2** The Applicant's card cancellations in June 2025 caused:
- Service disruptions to critical IT infrastructure
- Payment failures to vendors and service providers
- Operational chaos without warning
- Damage to vendor relationships and credit standing

**[X].11.3** The Applicant's interdict on August 19, 2025 caused:
- Complete inability to fulfill Responsible Person duties (37 jurisdictions)
- Regulatory crisis and compliance failures
- Customer communication disruptions
- Vendor relationship breakdowns
- **Quantified financial losses: R18,141,647.70+**
- **Regulatory exposure: R50,000,000+**

> **Evidence:** Annexure **JF-HARM-CALC** - Detailed harm calculation methodology.

**[X].11.4** The Applicant created a regulatory and financial crisis through his own unilateral actions, then cited this crisis as justification for maintaining the interdict.

**Causation Chain - Business Disruption:**
1. Pre-June 2025: Businesses profitable, growing, compliant
2. Applicant's Action: Card cancellations (June 7, 2025)
3. Direct Result: Service disruptions, operational chaos
4. Applicant's Action: Interdict blocking all access (August 19, 2025)
5. Direct Result: Regulatory crisis, R18M+ financial losses, R50M+ exposure
6. Applicant's Complaint: "Business mismanagement requiring intervention"

**[X].11.5** The Applicant's conduct caused far greater harm than any alleged misconduct:
- Alleged harm: R500,000 director loan withdrawal (against loan account credit)
- Applicant-caused harm: R18,141,647.70+ financial losses + R50,000,000+ regulatory exposure
- **Harm ratio: 36:1 minimum (financial only), infinite when including regulatory exposure**

### Legal Principles: Clean Hands and Causation

**[X].12** The equitable doctrine of "clean hands" provides that a party seeking equitable relief (such as an interdict) must approach the court with clean hands. A party cannot obtain equitable relief if their own conduct is tainted by bad faith, fraud, or inequitable behavior.

**[X].13** The Applicant's conduct violates this fundamental principle in multiple respects:

**[X].13.1** **Creating the Problem:** The Applicant created the documentation gaps and access issues he now complains about through his own deliberate actions (card cancellations, system restrictions, interdict).

**[X].13.2** **Refusing Cooperation:** The Applicant refused to engage with explanations and cooperation offered, then complained about lack of cooperation.

**[X].13.3** **Causing Greater Harm:** The Applicant's actions caused harm 36+ times greater than any alleged misconduct, violating the principle of proportionality.

**[X].13.4** **Bad Faith Conduct:** The Applicant's months-long delay, strategic timing, and material non-disclosures demonstrate bad faith throughout.

**[X].14** The causation principle provides that a party cannot rely on a problem they themselves created as justification for legal action. This principle is well-established in South African law and prevents parties from manufacturing justifications for relief.

**[X].15** In each of the four problem categories identified above, the Applicant's own conduct directly caused the problem he now cites as justification for the interdict:

| Problem | Applicant's Causative Action | Applicant's Complaint |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------|
| Documentation gap | Card cancellations cutting off access | "Unexplained expenses" |
| System access | Restricted credentials and permissions | "Insufficient detail" |
| Communication breakdown | Refused to engage with explanations | "Lack of cooperation" |
| Business disruption | Interdict blocking all access | "Business mismanagement" |

**[X].16** The Applicant cannot be permitted to profit from his own wrong. To allow the Applicant to rely on problems he himself created would:
- Violate the clean hands doctrine
- Undermine the causation principle
- Reward bad faith conduct
- Enable manipulation of the legal system
- Create perverse incentives for obstruction

---

### Conclusion on Causation Defense

**[X].17** I respectfully submit that the Applicant's interdict application fails on the independent ground of causation. The Applicant created the very problems he now complains about through his own deliberate, unilateral actions.

**[X].18** The Applicant approaches this Honourable Court with profoundly unclean hands:
- He cancelled cards that cut off documentation access, then complained about lack of documentation
- He restricted system access, then complained about insufficient detail
- He refused to engage with explanations, then complained about lack of cooperation
- He obtained an interdict that caused R18M+ in losses, then cited business disruption as justification

**[X].19** The equitable relief the Applicant seeks (continuation of the interdict) should be denied on the basis that:
1. The Applicant does not come to court with clean hands
2. The Applicant created the problems he relies upon
3. The Applicant's conduct violates fundamental principles of equity and fairness
4. The Applicant's actions caused disproportionate harm (36:1 ratio)

**[X].20** Even if all the Applicant's allegations were true (which they are not), the interdict should be set aside on the independent ground that the Applicant's own conduct created the alleged problems and bars equitable relief.
