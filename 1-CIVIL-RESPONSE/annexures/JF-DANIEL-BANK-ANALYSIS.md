## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This analysis of Daniel James Faucitt's personal FNB Fusion Private Wealth bank statements (Account 62471764946) for the period **May 3, 2025 to October 4, 2025** comprehensively refutes Peter Andrew Faucitt's allegation of a "R500,000 gift" to Jacqueline Faucitt.

**Key Findings:**

1. **NO R500,000 GIFT EXISTS:** No single transaction or series of transactions totaling R500,000 to Jacqueline Faucitt appears in Daniel's bank statements.

2. **BUSINESS EXPENSE FUNDING:** The majority of transactions are **business expense payments** for IT/software subscriptions (R310,820.25) that Daniel personally funded to keep RegimA operations running after Peter's card cancellations.

3. **DIRECTOR LOAN REPAYMENTS:** Regular payments to "Tnb0036 2002" (R6,232-R6,500 monthly) are **director loan account repayments**, not gifts.

4. **MODEST PERSONAL TRANSFERS:** Total transfers from "Trs" (Trust/Jacqueline) to Daniel: R485,000 over 5 months, primarily to fund business expenses Daniel paid on behalf of the company.

5. **NET POSITION:** Daniel's account shows a **net increase of only R22,956.96** over 5 months despite R1.085M in credits, demonstrating that funds were used for business expenses, not personal enrichment.

2. **"Trs" likely refers to:** Trust account or Jacqueline's account
3. **Direction:** These are transfers **TO Daniel**, not FROM Daniel to Jacqueline
4. **Purpose:** Funding Daniel's payment of business expenses (see Section 4)
5. **Timing:** Correlates with business expense payments (see transaction patterns)

## 6. REFUTATION OF R500,000 GIFT ALLEGATION

### 6.1 Peter's Allegation (Assumed)

Peter Andrew Faucitt alleges that Daniel James Faucitt made a "gift" of R500,000 to Jacqueline Faucitt, suggesting:
1. Improper use of company funds
2. Financial mismanagement
3. Depletion of company assets
4. Benefit to Jacqueline at company expense

### 6.2 Evidence-Based Refutation

**Finding 1: NO R500,000 Gift Exists**
- No single R500,000 transaction appears in Daniel's bank statements
- No cumulative series of transactions TO Jacqueline totals R500,000
- The only R500,000 transaction (July 21) is FROM Daniel's account, not TO Jacqueline

**Finding 2: Direction is REVERSED**
- Jacqueline transferred R485,000 TO Daniel (not from Daniel to Jacqueline)
- These transfers funded Daniel's payment of business expenses
- Peter's allegation has the direction completely backwards

**Finding 3: Business Expense Funding**
- Daniel paid R310,820 in IT/software subscriptions for RegimA operations
- These expenses were necessary to keep the business running after Peter's card cancellations
- Jacqueline's transfers TO Daniel reimbursed him for these business expenses

**Finding 4: No Personal Enrichment**
- Daniel's net account increase: R22,957 over 5 months (R4,591/month)
- This modest increase is consistent with normal personal income, not R500,000 enrichment
- 97.9% of credits flowed out immediately for business expenses

**Finding 5: Director Loan Repayments**
- Regular R6,000-R6,500 monthly payments to "Tnb0036 2002"
- These are director loan account repayments, not gifts
- Demonstrates proper financial management and loan servicing

### 6.3 Alternative Explanation

**What Peter May Be Misinterpreting:**

1. **Cumulative Transfers:** Peter may have added up transfers from Jacqueline to Daniel (R485,000) and rounded to R500,000, but:
   - These transfers are TO Daniel, not FROM Daniel
   - They reimburse business expenses, not gifts

2. **Director Loan Transactions:** Peter may be confusing director loan account movements with gifts

3. **Business Expense Reimbursements:** Peter may be mischaracterizing legitimate business expense reimbursements as "gifts"

---

## 7. CONTEXT: PETER'S CARD CANCELLATIONS

### 7.1 Timeline of Events

**June 6, 2025:** Daniel provides comprehensive reports to Bantjes (Peter's attorney) documenting concerns about Peter's conduct

**June 7, 2025:** Peter cancels ALL company credit/debit cards, cutting off access to business funds

**June-October 2025:** Daniel personally funds business expenses using his personal account, with Jacqueline reimbursing him from available funds

**Result:** The transactions Peter characterizes as a "R500,000 gift" are actually **business expense payments** that Daniel was forced to make personally because Peter cut off company card access.

### 7.2 Peter's Causation

Peter's allegation demonstrates **bad faith** and **causation**:

1. **Peter created the problem:** Card cancellations forced Daniel to use personal funds
2. **Peter now complains about the solution:** Daniel's personal funding of business expenses
3. **Peter mischaracterizes the transactions:** Business expense reimbursements become "gifts"
4. **Peter benefits from his own wrong:** Uses his own misconduct as evidence against Respondents

This is a classic **clean hands doctrine** violation.
