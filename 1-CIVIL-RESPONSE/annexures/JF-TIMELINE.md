# PETER'S BAD FAITH: TIMELINE ANALYSIS
## Case No: 2025-137857
## Annexure: JF-TIMELINE

---

## Executive Summary

This timeline analysis demonstrates that Peter Faucitt's interdict application was not a good-faith response to newly discovered misconduct, but rather a **strategically timed legal maneuver** characterized by bad faith, ulterior motives, and manufactured urgency. The evidence reveals a pattern of:

1. **Years of knowledge and participation** in the informal director loan model
2. **Months-long delay** between alleged "discovery" and legal action (contradicting urgency claims)
3. **Strategic timing** relative to settlement negotiations and investment payout timeline
4. **Causation by obstruction** - Peter created the documentation gaps he now complains about
5. **Selective memory and hypocrisy** - Peter objects to practices he himself engaged in for years

**Key Finding:** Peter waited **months** after having full knowledge of the financial arrangements before filing an "urgent" ex parte interdict, demonstrating calculated strategic behavior rather than genuine concern.

---

## Phase 1: Historical Knowledge and Participation (2017-2023)

### The Established Practice: Informal Director Loan Model

For years, all directors (including Peter) participated in an informal director loan account model without board resolutions or formal documentation.

| Period | Event | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| **2017-2023** | Informal director loan model established | All directors withdraw funds against loan accounts without board resolutions |
| **Multiple dates** | Peter's own withdrawals | Peter participated in the same informal practice he now claims is misconduct |
| **2019-2020** | Inter-company financial structures | Trial balance evidence shows established financial relationships |
| **2020-2023** | Peter receives financial reports | Peter had access to all financial information through accountant Bantjes |

**Evidence Required:**
- Peter's own director loan account withdrawals (JF-PA1 through JF-PA4)
- Historical financial reports provided to Peter
- Board meeting minutes showing no objections to informal practice
- Accountant correspondence showing Peter's receipt of financial information

**Conclusion:** Peter had full knowledge of and actively participated in the director loan model for years without objection.

---

## Phase 2: Business Operations and IT Infrastructure (2017-2025)

### Peter's Knowledge of International Operations

Peter was fully aware of RegimA's international operations across 37 jurisdictions and the associated IT infrastructure requirements.

| Date | Event | Peter's Knowledge |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **2017-2023** | International expansion | Peter received reports on international operations |
| **Ongoing** | IT infrastructure costs | Peter had access to financial statements showing IT expenses |
| **2022-2024** | Revenue growth (R2M â†’ R19M) | Peter benefited from growth enabled by IT investment |
| **Multiple dates** | Shopify Plus, AWS, Microsoft 365 | Peter knew about enterprise platforms supporting operations |

**Evidence:**
- Financial statements showing IT expenses (provided to Peter annually)
- Board discussions about international expansion
- Peter's acknowledgment of business growth and profitability

**Conclusion:** Peter knew about IT expenses and their necessity for international operations, yet only raised concerns when strategically convenient.

---

## Phase 3: The Fraud Discovery and Confrontation (May 2025)

### Critical Trigger Event: Jax's Confrontation

The timeline reveals a critical trigger event that catalyzed Peter's subsequent actions.

| Date | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **May 15, 2025** | **CRITICAL EVENT**: Jax confronts Rynette about missing money | Jax notifies that funds need to be paid to ReZonance & Kayla's estate |
| **May 22, 2025** | **7 days later**: Shopify audit trail destruction | All orders and audit trails disappear from Shopify |
| **May 29, 2025** | **14 days later**: Domain appropriation | Adderory (Rynette's son) purchases regimaskin.co.za |
| **June 7, 2025** | **23 days later**: Card cancellations | Peter secretly cancels all business bank cards without warning |

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Jax's confrontation about fraud triggers coordinated response
- Systematic evidence destruction follows within days
- Infrastructure control consolidated within weeks
- Financial control seized within a month

**Conclusion:** Peter's actions were reactive to Jax's fraud discovery, not proactive concern about business management.

---

## Phase 4: Peter's Causation - Creating the Problems (June 2025)

### Peter Creates the Documentation Gap

Peter's unilateral actions directly created the problems he would later cite as justification for the interdict.

| Date | Peter's Action | Immediate Effect | Consequence |
|------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| **June 6, 2025** | Daniel provides comprehensive reports to Bantjes | Full cooperation with oversight | Legitimate information sharing |
| **June 7, 2025** | **Peter secretly cancels business cards** | Payment failures for cloud storage, accounting software, email systems | **Loss of access to documentation** |
| **June 10, 2025** | Daniel reports fraud to Bantjes | Whistleblower seeking proper governance | Bantjes dismisses: "I am going away for 2 weeks" |
| **Mid-June 2025** | **Peter restricts system access** | Daniel cannot retrieve historical records | **Cannot provide detailed breakdowns** |
| **June-July 2025** | **Peter refuses to engage** | No opportunity to clarify or provide context | **Communication breakdown** |
| **July 2025** | **Peter demands documentation** | Requests what his own actions made inaccessible | **Entrapment** |

**Causation Chain:**

**Problem 1: Documentation Gap**
- Peter's Action: Cancelled business credit cards
- Direct Result: Loss of access to cloud-based documentation systems
- Peter's Complaint: "Lack of documentation for IT expenses"
- **Causation:** Peter created the gap by cutting off access

**Problem 2: System Access Issues**
- Peter's Action: Restricted system credentials and access
- Direct Result: Inability to retrieve historical records
- Peter's Complaint: "Insufficient explanation of expenses"
- **Causation:** Peter blocked access to the systems containing explanations

**Problem 3: Communication Breakdown**
- Peter's Action: Refused to engage with explanations, ignored emails
- Direct Result: No opportunity for clarification
- Peter's Complaint: "Lack of transparency and cooperation"
- **Causation:** Peter refused the cooperation offered

**Evidence:**
- JF8A: Detailed log of all documentation provided to Peter
- System access logs showing restrictions imposed by Peter
- Email correspondence showing cooperation attempts and Peter's non-response
- Timeline showing card cancellations preceded documentation requests

**Conclusion:** Peter cannot rely on problems he himself created. This violates the "clean hands" doctrine and demonstrates bad faith.

---

## Phase 5: The Strategic Delay (June-August 2025)

### Months-Long Delay Contradicts Urgency Claims

If Peter genuinely believed there was urgent misconduct requiring immediate court intervention, why did he wait **months** before taking action?

| Date | Event | Days Since "Discovery" | Urgency Indicator |
|------|-------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **June 6, 2025** | Daniel provides reports to Bantjes | Day 0 | Peter has full information |
| **June 10, 2025** | Daniel reports fraud concerns | Day 4 | Peter aware of whistleblower report |
| **July 16, 2025** | R500K payment to Jax | Day 40 | Peter aware of specific transaction |
| **July-August** | Peter makes no objection | Days 40-70 | **No urgency demonstrated** |
| **August 5, 2025** | Settlement agreement signed | Day 60 | **Strategic timing begins** |
| **August 13, 2025** | **Peter files ex parte interdict** | Day 68 | **Sudden "urgency"** |
| **August 19, 2025** | Interdict granted | Day 74 | Mission accomplished |

**Critical Questions:**

1. **Why wait 68 days** if the situation was truly urgent?
2. **Why no communication** during the 2-month period?
3. **Why ex parte** instead of giving respondents notice?
4. **Why immediately after settlement** rather than when "misconduct" allegedly discovered?

**Conclusion:** The delay demonstrates calculated strategic timing, not genuine urgency.

---

## Phase 6: Strategic Timing Analysis (August 2025)

### Correlation with Settlement and Investment Timeline

Peter's interdict application was strategically timed to coincide with two critical events:

| Date | Event | Strategic Significance |
|------|-------|------------------------|
| **August 5, 2025** | Settlement agreement signed | **8 days before interdict** |
| **August 13, 2025** | Peter files interdict | Immediately after settlement secured |
| **Future date** | Investment payout (9-month timeline) | Peter seeks control before payout |

**Settlement Agreement Context:**
- Settlement signed just 8 days before interdict application
- Settlement creates 9-month timeline for investment payout
- Peter seeks to consolidate control before payout occurs
- Interdict provides leverage in settlement enforcement

**"Has Anything Changed?" Exchange:**
- Peter asked Daniel: "Has anything changed?"
- This occurred **after** Peter had full knowledge of financial arrangements
- Peter's question demonstrates he knew nothing had changed
- Yet Peter proceeded to file interdict claiming urgent new concerns

**Evidence:**
- Settlement agreement dated August 5, 2025
- Daniel's witness statement regarding "Has anything changed?" exchange
- Investment payout timeline documentation
- Timeline showing interdict filed immediately after settlement

**Conclusion:** The timing was strategic, not reactive. Peter used the interdict to gain leverage in settlement negotiations and control before investment payout.

---

## Phase 7: The "Unexplained" IT Expenses Pretext (August 2025)

### Manufactured Urgency Around Known Expenses

Peter characterized IT expenses as "unexplained" despite having had access to this information for years.

| Claim | Reality | Bad Faith Indicator |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| "Unexplained IT expenses" | Peter received financial statements annually showing IT costs | **Selective amnesia** |
| "Questionable foreign payments" | Payments to Shopify, AWS, Microsoft - industry-standard platforms | **Manufactured concern** |
| "Excessive foreign quota usage (80%)" | Appropriate for 37-jurisdiction international operations | **False characterization** |
| "Lack of documentation" | Peter's card cancellations cut off access to documentation | **Self-created problem** |

**Evidence:**
- Historical financial statements provided to Peter (showing IT expenses)
- Dan's technical affidavit (explaining IT infrastructure requirements)
- IT spend industry comparative analysis (showing expenses within norms)
- JF8A documentation log (showing cooperation attempts)

**Conclusion:** Peter manufactured urgency around expenses he had known about for years, only raising concerns when strategically convenient.

---

## Phase 8: The Ex Parte Deception (August 13-19, 2025)

### Material Non-Disclosures in Ex Parte Application

Peter's ex parte application omitted critical information that would have prevented the interdict from being granted.

| What Peter Told the Court | What Peter Omitted | Impact on Court's Decision |
|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| "Unexplained IT expenses" | Peter had financial statements for years | Court misled about novelty |
| "Urgent action required" | Peter waited 68 days after "discovery" | Court misled about urgency |
| "Lack of cooperation" | Daniel provided comprehensive reports June 6 | Court misled about cooperation |
| "Questionable transactions" | Peter participated in same practice for years | Court misled about legitimacy |
| "Business at risk" | Business profitable and growing (R2M â†’ R19M) | Court misled about harm |
| "No alternative remedy" | Peter had absolute powers as trustee | Court misled about necessity |

**Seven Material Non-Disclosures:**
1. Peter's own participation in informal director loan model
2. Peter's months-long delay contradicting urgency
3. Peter's card cancellations creating documentation gap
4. Daniel's cooperation and provision of comprehensive reports
5. Business profitability and growth trajectory
6. Peter's absolute powers as trustee (alternative remedies available)
7. **Disproportionate harm** - Interdict would cause R18M+ losses vs R500K alleged

**Conclusion:** Peter obtained the interdict through material non-disclosure and deception, rendering it void ab initio.

---

## Phase 9: Post-Interdict Escalation (September-October 2025)

### Pattern of Malicious Prosecution

Peter's actions after obtaining the interdict demonstrate ongoing bad faith.

| Date | Event | Pattern |
|------|-------|---------|
| **August 19, 2025** | First interdict granted | Financial control seized |
| **September 24, 2025** | ENS Africa withdraws after receiving proof of perjury | Peter's attorneys recognize fraud |
| **October 2025** | Peter files **second interdict** for forced medical testing | **Escalation to witness intimidation** |

**Second Interdict Analysis:**
- Fabricated allegations (gambling, pornography)
- Bank statements disprove allegations
- Attempt to discredit Daniel through invasive medical testing
- Classic witness intimidation tactic

**Conclusion:** The pattern escalated from financial fraud to active witness intimidation, confirming malicious intent throughout.

---

## Bad Faith Indicators Summary

- Restricted system access preventing retrieval
- Demanded documentation his actions made inaccessible

**4. Hypocrisy**
- Objects to practices he himself engaged in
- Claims lack of cooperation after refusing to engage
- Alleges urgency after months of delay

**5. Material Non-Disclosure**
- Omitted seven critical facts from ex parte application
- Misled court about urgency, cooperation, and harm
- Obtained interdict through deception

**6. Ulterior Motives**
- Settlement leverage

- Silencing whistleblower (Daniel's fraud report)
- Protecting Rynette Farrar's interests

**7. Escalating Abuse**
- First interdict: Financial control
- Second interdict: Witness intimidation
- Pattern of malicious prosecution

## Legal Implications

### Clean Hands Doctrine

Peter approaches the court with profoundly "unclean hands":
- Created the problems he complains about
- Participated in the practices he now condemns
- Obtained relief through material non-disclosure
- Used legal system to obstruct fraud investigation

**Legal Principle:** A party seeking equitable relief (interdict) must come to court with "clean hands." Peter's bad faith conduct bars his claim to equitable relief.

### Causation Defense

Peter cannot rely on problems he himself created:
- Card cancellations â†’ documentation gap
- System restrictions â†’ inability to provide records
- Refusal to engage â†’ communication breakdown
- Interdict â†’ business disruption

**Legal Principle:** A party cannot create a problem and then rely on it as justification for legal action.

### Proportionality

Peter's actions caused far greater harm than any alleged misconduct:
- Alleged harm: R500K withdrawal (against loan account credit)
- Interdict-caused harm: R18M+ financial losses, R50M+ regulatory exposure
- **Harm ratio: 36:1 minimum**

**Legal Principle:** Equitable relief must be proportionate to the alleged harm. Peter's interdict is grossly disproportionate.

---

## Conclusion

The timeline analysis demonstrates conclusively that Peter Faucitt's interdict application was characterized by bad faith throughout:

1. âœ… **Knowledge:** Peter knew about financial arrangements for years
2. âœ… **Participation:** Peter engaged in the same practices he now condemns
3. âœ… **Delay:** Peter waited months despite claimed urgency
4. âœ… **Strategic Timing:** Filed immediately after settlement, before investment payout
5. âœ… **Causation:** Peter created the problems he complains about
6. âœ… **Deception:** Peter obtained interdict through material non-disclosure
7. âœ… **Ulterior Motives:** Settlement leverage, payout control, whistleblower silencing
8. âœ… **Escalation:** Pattern of malicious prosecution and witness intimidation

**Peter's interdict application was not a good-faith response to newly discovered misconduct. It was a calculated legal maneuver designed to gain strategic advantage in settlement negotiations, consolidate control before an investment payout, and silence a whistleblower who had reported fraud.**

The Court was misled through material non-disclosures, and the interdict should be set aside as void ab initio.
