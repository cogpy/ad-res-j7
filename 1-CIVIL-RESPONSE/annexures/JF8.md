## Section 5: Documentation Gap Causation

### 5.1 How Peter Created the Documentation Gap

**Problem:** Peter alleges lack of documentation for IT expenses and transactions

**Reality:** Documentation existed but Peter made it inaccessible through his own actions

**Causation Chain:**

**Step 1: Card Cancellations (June 7, 2025)**
- Peter cancelled all business bank cards without warning
- Payment failures for cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft 365)
- Service suspensions cut off access to documentation systems
- Invoices, receipts, and records became inaccessible

**Step 2: System Restrictions (June-July 2025)**
- Peter restricted Daniel's access to business systems
- Prevented retrieval of historical records
- Blocked access to accounting software, email systems, cloud storage
- Documentation existed but was made inaccessible

**Step 3: Interdict (August 19, 2025)**
- Peter obtained interdict blocking all system access
- Completed the obstruction begun in June
- Made it impossible to retrieve or provide documentation
- Then cited lack of documentation as justification for interdict

**Conclusion:** Peter created the documentation gap through deliberate obstruction, then used it as justification for the interdict.

---

### 5.2 Clean Hands Doctrine

**Legal Principle:** A party seeking equitable relief must come to court with "clean hands"

**Application:**
- Peter created the documentation gap through his own actions
- Peter refused to engage with cooperation attempts
- Peter then complained about lack of documentation and cooperation
- Peter seeks interdict based on problems he himself created

**Conclusion:** Peter's conduct violates the clean hands doctrine and bars equitable relief.

---

## Section 6: Comparison: Cooperation vs. Allegations

### 6.1 Peter's Allegations vs. Reality

| Peter's Allegation | Reality (Evidence) | Conclusion |
|--------------------|-------------------|------------|
| "Unexplained IT expenses" | Dan's technical affidavit explains all expenses | FALSE |
| "Lack of documentation" | Peter's actions cut off access to documentation | PETER'S FAULT |
| "Lack of transparency" | Daniel provided comprehensive reports June 6 | FALSE |
| "Lack of cooperation" | Peter refused to engage with cooperation attempts | PROJECTION |
| "Questionable payments" | Payments to Shopify, AWS, Microsoft - standard platforms | FALSE |
| "Unauthorized withdrawals" | Director loan model used by all directors for years | HYPOCRISY |

**Conclusion:** Peter's allegations are contradicted by the documentary evidence and are, in many cases, projections of his own conduct.

---

### 6.2 Pattern of Bad Faith

**Peter's Pattern:**
1. Received comprehensive reports (June 6)
2. Cancelled cards the next day (June 7)
3. Restricted system access (June-July)
4. Refused to engage with cooperation attempts (June-July)
5. Created documentation gap through obstruction
6. Filed interdict citing lack of documentation (August 13)
7. Obtained interdict through material non-disclosure (August 19)

**Conclusion:** Peter's conduct demonstrates a pattern of bad faith designed to manufacture justification for the interdict.
