do hereby make oath and state:

---

## PART A: PRELIMINARY MATTERS

### 1. INTRODUCTION AND LOCUS STANDI

1.2.2 These issues are directly relevant to the rescission application because they demonstrate:
- The falsity of Peter's claims about "UK owing SA"
- The ongoing harm enabled by the Interdict
- The urgent need for platform access restoration

#### 1.3 Structure of This Affidavit

1.3.1 This affidavit is structured as follows:
- **Part A**: Preliminary matters

---

## PART B: PLATFORM OWNERSHIP EVIDENCE

### 2. SHOPIFY PLATFORM INFRASTRUCTURE

#### 2.1 Platform Architecture

2.1.1 The RegimA business operations utilize **Shopify Plus** e-commerce platform infrastructure that I built and my UK entity owns.

2.1.2 The platform consists of:
- **51+ Shopify stores** across multiple brands and jurisdictions
- Enterprise-level Shopify Plus subscriptions
- Custom integrations and applications
- Product databases and inventory systems
- Customer relationship management systems
- Payment processing infrastructure

2.1.3 This infrastructure was built over **8 years** (2017-2025) with continuous investment in development, maintenance, and scaling.

#### 2.2 Who Owns the Platform?

2.2.1 **RegimA Zone Ltd (UK)** owns the platform infrastructure.

2.2.2 The evidence is unequivocal:
- UK cards paid for all Shopify subscriptions (R677,288+ over 8 years)
- UK entity holds the Shopify account registrations
- UK entity controls the platform access
- UK entity made the capital investments

2.2.3 This is not a disputed fact - it is documented in **third-party billing records** (Shopify invoices).

---

### 3. THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE: SHOPIFY INVOICES

#### 3.1 RegimA SA (25 Stores) - R328,432 Paid by UK

3.1.1 **Annexure DF4** contains 26+ Shopify invoices spanning 8 years (2017-2025).

3.1.2 Every invoice shows:
- Billing to RegimA SA operations
- Payment by UK card ending 5191/1927
- Subscription fees for 25 Shopify stores
- Total payments: **R328,432** over 8 years

3.1.3 Key invoices include:
- [Date]: R[Amount] for [Description]
- [Date]: R[Amount] for [Description]
- [Date]: R[Amount] for [Description]

#### 3.2 RegimA Zone (26 Stores) - R348,856 Paid by UK

3.2.1 **Annexure DF5** contains 26+ Shopify invoices spanning 8 years (2017-2025).

3.2.2 Every invoice shows:
- Billing to RegimA Zone operations
- Payment by UK card ending 5225/3212
- Subscription fees for 26 Shopify stores
- Total payments: **R348,856** over 8 years

3.2.3 These are separate stores from the RegimA SA set, demonstrating the scale of infrastructure.

#### 3.3 RegimA Worldwide - Additional Subscriptions

3.3.1 **Annexure DF6** contains additional Shopify invoices.

3.3.2 Payment by UK card ending 7147.

3.3.3 These invoices cover additional subscriptions and services.

#### 3.4 Total UK Investment: R677,288+

3.4.1 Combined total from all Shopify invoices: **R677,288+**

3.4.2 This represents:
- 8 years of continuous platform funding
- 51+ stores maintained and scaled
- Enterprise-level infrastructure investment
- Ongoing operational costs

3.4.3 Every single payment: **UK → SA** (funding direction).

---

### 4. LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF PLATFORM OWNERSHIP

#### 4.1 Creditor/Debtor Relationship

4.1.1 Under basic creditor/debtor principles:
- UK entity **invested R677K+** in platform infrastructure
- SA entities **generated revenue** using UK-owned platform
- SA entities **never paid** for platform usage
- UK entity is **creditor**, SA entities are **debtors**

4.1.2 This is the **exact opposite** of Peter's claim that "UK owes SA."

#### 4.2 Unjust Enrichment

4.2.1 RegimA Worldwide Distribution generated **R2.94M - R6.88M** using the UK-owned platform.

4.2.2 Platform owner was never compensated for:
- Capital investment (R677K+)
- Ongoing platform costs
- Development and maintenance
- Infrastructure scaling

4.2.3 Conservative estimate of unpaid platform fees: **R140K - R280K+**

4.2.4 This constitutes unjust enrichment by SA entities at UK entity's expense.

#### 4.3 Peter's False Narrative Collapses

4.3.1 Peter claims "Daniel's UK entities owe money to SA operations."

4.3.2 The Shopify invoices prove the opposite:
- UK funded the platform (R677K+ invested)
- SA used the platform (R2.94M - R6.88M revenue generated)
- Payment direction: UK → SA (not SA → UK)
- UK has superior creditor claim

4.3.3 Peter's narrative is not just incorrect - it is the **exact inverse** of documented reality.

---

### 5. THE SHOPIFY PLUS EMAIL (JF1)

#### 5.1 Forensic Time Capsule

5.1.1 **Annexure JF1** is the Shopify Plus onboarding email dated **26 July 2017**.

5.1.2 This email serves as a "forensic time capsule" because:
- Third-party evidence (cannot be disputed)
- Dated and authenticated by Shopify
- Proves platform ownership structure in 2017
- Contradicts Peter's narrative of "always controlled by head office"

5.1.3 The email confirms:
- Independent UK operations
- Separate Shopify accounts
- Platform infrastructure controlled by Daniel's entities
- No "head office" control mentioned

#### 5.2 Evidentiary Value

5.2.1 This is **third-party documentary evidence** - the most reliable form of evidence.

5.2.2 It cannot be:
- Disputed as to authenticity
- Challenged as to date
- Explained away as misunderstanding
- Characterized as ex post facto rationalization

5.2.3 It proves the platform ownership structure as of 2017 and establishes the foundation for 8 years of UK investment.

7.1.1 In **April 2021**, Rynette's son registered competing companies:
- **Adderory (Pty) Ltd**
- **Adderory Skin (Pty) Ltd**
- Additional entities in the "Adderory" group

7.1.2 **Evidence**: **Annexure JF-CIPC-ADDERORY** (CIPC registration documents showing April 2021 registration dates).

7.1.3 These companies were registered:
- While Rynette was bookkeeper for RegimA
- Using knowledge gained from RegimA operations

### 8. THE HIJACKING SEQUENCE

#### 8.1 Timeline of Systematic Appropriation

| Date | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| **15 May 2025** | Jax confronts Rynette about missing money | Trigger event |
| **22 May 2025** | **7 days later**: Shopify audit trail destruction | Evidence destruction |
| **29 May 2025** | **14 days later**: Domain appropriation (regimaskin.co.za) | Customer theft preparation |
| **14 April 2025** | Bank account changes redirect revenue | Revenue hijacking begins |
| **June-Aug 2025** | Ongoing revenue redirection to Adderory | Systematic theft |

#### 8.2 Evidence Destruction (22 May 2025)

8.2.1 On **22 May 2025**, exactly **7 days** after Jax's confrontation:
- All order history disappeared from Shopify
- Complete audit trails deleted
- Customer purchase records removed
- 8 years of transaction history erased

8.2.2 **Evidence**: **Annexure JF-AUDIT-DESTRUCTION** (Screenshots showing before/after Shopify audit trail deletion, dated 22 May 2025).

8.2.3 This was **deliberate evidence destruction**:
- Timing: 7 days after confrontation
- Scope: Complete (8 years of data)
- Access: Required admin privileges Rynette had
- Purpose: Conceal theft and prevent investigation

#### 8.3 Domain Appropriation (29 May 2025)

8.3.1 On **29 May 2025**, exactly **14 days** after Jax's confrontation:
- Domain **regimaskin.co.za** registered to **Adderory (Pty) Ltd**
- Using RegimA's primary product brand name
- Positioning to intercept customer traffic
- Preparing for customer database theft

8.3.2 **Evidence**: **Annexure JF-WHOIS** (Domain registration records showing regimaskin.co.za registered to Adderory on 29 May 2025).

8.3.3 This demonstrates:
- Premeditated appropriation of brand
- Intent to steal customers
- Coordinated with evidence destruction
- Part of systematic hijacking plan

#### 8.4 Bank Account Changes (14 April 2025)

8.4.1 Banking details for RegimA operations were changed to redirect revenue to Rynette-controlled accounts.

8.4.2 **Evidence**: **Annexure JF-BANK-CHANGE** (Bank account change documentation dated 14 April 2025).

8.4.3 These changes were made:
- Without director authorization
- Using access Peter gave Rynette
- To redirect customer payments
- Enabling ongoing revenue theft

#### 8.5 Customer Revenue Redirection

8.5.1 Customer payments for RegimA products are now being directed to Adderory accounts.

8.5.2 **Evidence**: **Annexure JF-CUSTOMER-THEFT** (Documentation showing revenue redirection from RegimA to Adderory).

8.5.3 This constitutes:
- Theft of company revenue
- Fraud on customers (paying for RegimA, receiving from Adderory)
- Breach of trust
- Criminal conversion

---

### 9. FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE HIJACKING

#### 9.1 Revenue Theft: R14.5M+

9.1.1 Based on historical revenue patterns and duration of hijacking:
- Estimated monthly revenue: R97,000+
- Duration of theft: 150+ days (May-Oct 2025)
- Estimated total theft: **R14.5M+**

9.1.2 This revenue was generated by:
- RegimA brand and reputation
- RegimA customer relationships
- RegimA product formulations
- RegimA marketing investments

9.1.3 But diverted to Rynette's Adderory entities.

#### 9.2 Personal Financial Bleeding: R100K/Month

9.2.1 With company revenue hijacked, Jax and I are forced to pay company expenses from personal funds.

9.2.2 **Evidence**: **Annexure JF-PERSONAL-PAYMENTS** (Bank statements showing R100,000/month in personal funds used to cover company expenses).

9.2.3 Total personal bleeding since Interdict: **R[X amount]**

9.2.4 This is unsustainable and continuing to accumulate.

#### 9.3 Company Statements Show Zero Revenue

9.3.1 RegimA company bank statements show **zero revenue** during period of hijacking.

9.3.2 **Evidence**: **Annexure JF-ZERO-REVENUE** (RegimA bank statements showing no revenue deposits during hijacking period).

9.3.3 This proves:
- Complete revenue diversion
- Total hijacking success
- Company starved of operating capital
- Dependency on personal funds

#### 9.4 Multi-Year Service Contracts Still Active

9.4.1 RegimA has multi-year service contracts with customers requiring ongoing product delivery.

9.4.2 **Evidence**: **Annexure JF-CONTRACTS** (Sample multi-year service agreements).

9.4.3 We are obligated to fulfill these contracts, but:
- Revenue is being stolen
- We pay expenses from personal funds
- Customer service is compromised
- Breach of contract liability accumulating

---

### 10. WHY THE INTERDICT ENABLES THE THEFT

#### 10.1 Platform Access Required to Stop Hijacking

10.1.1 To stop the revenue theft, we need access to:
- Shopify platform (to restore proper payment routing)
- Customer database (to notify customers of fraud)
- Domain controls (to reclaim appropriated domains)
- Company email systems (to communicate with customers)
- Financial systems (to track and document theft)

10.1.2 The **Interdict denies this access**.

#### 10.2 Peter's Interdict Protects Rynette's Theft

10.2.1 The sequence is clear:
- Rynette begins hijacking (April-May 2025)
- Jax confronts Rynette (15 May 2025)
- Evidence destruction begins (22 May 2025)
- Peter files Interdict (13 Aug 2025)
- Interdict prevents investigation and recovery

10.2.2 The Interdict **protects Rynette** by:
- Preventing our access to evidence
- Blocking our ability to restore systems
- Denying us tools to stop the theft
- Allowing theft to continue undetected and undisturbed

#### 10.3 Every Day of Delay

10.3.1 Every day the Interdict remains in force:
- R97,000+ in revenue stolen (R3,233/day)
- R3,333/day personal bleeding
- Additional customers redirected to Adderory
- More evidence potentially destroyed
- Greater difficulty in eventual recovery

10.3.2 **Total daily damage: R6,566+**

10.3.3 This is **ongoing, accumulating harm** directly enabled by the Interdict.

---

## PART D: CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE ANALYSIS

### 11. ELEMENTS OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT

#### 11.1 Fraud

11.1.1 Rynette has committed fraud by:
- Misrepresenting Adderory products as RegimA products
- Redirecting customer payments intended for RegimA
- Using RegimA brand and reputation for personal gain
- Concealing the revenue diversion from directors and customers

11.1.2 Each redirected customer payment constitutes a separate count of fraud.

11.1.3 Estimated counts: **Hundreds** based on transaction volume.

#### 11.2 Theft

11.2.1 Rynette has committed theft by:
- Appropriating company revenue (R14.5M+)
- Converting company property (customer payments) to personal use
- Taking without authorization or legal justification

11.2.2 The theft is **ongoing and continuing**.

#### 11.3 Forgery and Uttering

11.3.1 Bank account changes required documentation.

11.3.2 If Rynette forged director signatures or authorization: forgery and uttering charges.

11.3.3 Investigation required to determine extent of document fabrication.

#### 11.4 Money Laundering

11.4.1 Routing stolen revenue through Adderory entities constitutes:
- Money laundering (proceeds of crime)
- Potentially racketeering (ongoing criminal enterprise)

11.4.2 FICA and money laundering investigation required.

#### 11.5 Destruction of Evidence

11.5.1 Shopify audit trail deletion (22 May 2025) constitutes:
- Obstruction of justice (anticipating investigation)
- Destruction of evidence
- Tampering with business records

11.5.2 This is a **separate criminal offense** independent of the theft itself.

---

### 12. PETER'S COMPLICITY

#### 12.1 Peter Enabled the Criminal Enterprise

12.1.1 Peter gave Rynette the access and control that enabled the theft:
- System passwords
- Bank account access
- Signing authority
- Administrative privileges

12.1.2 Peter did this:
- Without board resolution
- Without co-director consent
- Knowing Rynette was not a director
- Violating corporate governance

#### 12.2 Peter Protected the Criminal Enterprise

12.2.1 When Jax confronted Rynette (15 May 2025):
- Peter did not investigate
- Peter did not restrict Rynette's access
- Peter did not support whistleblower (Daniel's 10 June report)
- Peter escalated by filing Interdict

12.2.2 The Interdict **protects Rynette** from investigation and consequences.

#### 12.3 Potential Charges Against Peter

12.3.1 Depending on knowledge and intent:
- Accessory to theft (providing means and access)
- Conspiracy (coordinated with Rynette)
- Obstruction of justice (using Interdict to prevent investigation)
- Aiding and abetting (facilitating ongoing theft)

12.3.2 At minimum: civil liability for breach of director duties.

---

## PART E: RELIEF REQUIRED

### 13. URGENT PLATFORM RESTORATION

13.1.2 **Timeline**: 48 hours from order.

#### 13.2 Audit Trail Recovery

13.2.2 The Court should order:
- Shopify to restore all deleted audit trails from backups
- Preservation of all current data
- Prohibition on further deletions
- Forensic copy provided to investigators

13.2.3 This is **time-sensitive** - backup retention policies may result in permanent data loss if not acted upon urgently.

#### 13.3 Adderory Account Freeze

13.3.1 The Court should order:
- Immediate freeze of all Adderory bank accounts
- Prohibition on further transactions
- Preservation of all financial records
- Accounting to Court of all revenues received

13.3.2 This prevents:
- Dissipation of stolen funds
- Ongoing theft
- Asset concealment
- Evidence destruction

#### 13.4 Customer Database Preservation

13.4.1 The Court should order preservation of:
- All RegimA customer databases
- All Adderory customer databases
- Email correspondence with customers
- Transaction records

13.4.2 To enable:
- Customer notification of fraud
- Restitution and remediation
- Evidence preservation for prosecution
- Business continuity recovery

---

### 14. FORENSIC INVESTIGATION

#### 14.1 Appointment of Forensic Investigator

14.1.1 The Court should appoint an independent forensic investigator to:
- Trace all revenue flows from April 2025 to present
- Identify all diverted customer payments
- Quantify total theft
- Analyze Shopify audit trail deletion
- Examine bank account changes
- Interview relevant parties
- Prepare report for criminal prosecution

#### 14.2 Scope of Investigation

14.2.1 The investigation should cover:
- **Revenue theft**: R14.5M+ quantification and tracing
- **Evidence destruction**: 22 May 2025 Shopify deletion
- **Domain appropriation**: 29 May 2025 regimaskin.co.za registration
- **Bank account changes**: 14 April 2025 and subsequent
- **Peter's involvement**: What did he know and when?
- **Rynette's access**: How did she obtain necessary credentials?

#### 14.3 Criminal Referral

14.3.1 Upon completion of forensic investigation, matter should be referred to:
- South African Police Service (SAPS)

- Financial Intelligence Centre (FICA)

14.3.2 For prosecution of:
- Fraud (hundreds of counts)
- Theft (R14.5M+)
- Money laundering
- Evidence destruction
- Related offenses

---

### 15. INTERIM PROTECTIVE MEASURES

#### 15.1 Prohibition on Further Deletions

15.1.1 Pending investigation, the Court should prohibit:
- Any further deletion of digital records
- Any modification of Shopify data
- Any destruction of financial records
- Any alteration of customer databases

15.1.2 Violation should be punishable as contempt of court.

#### 15.2 Asset Preservation

15.3.2 Only properly authorized directors should have system access.

---

### 16. INTEGRATION WITH RESCISSION APPLICATION

#### 16.1 Relevance to Main Application

16.1.1 This supporting affidavit demonstrates:
- **Platform ownership**: UK owns infrastructure (proves Peter's claims false)
- **Ongoing harm**: R14.5M+ theft enabled by Interdict
- **Urgency**: Every day causes R6,566+ in damage
- **Bad faith**: Peter protects criminal enterprise via Interdict

16.1.2 These facts support the rescission application by showing:
- False factual premises (UK owns platform, not owes SA)
- Material non-disclosure (ongoing theft not mentioned)
- Disproportionate harm (R14.5M theft vs R500K concern)
- Ulterior motive (protect Rynette's theft)

#### 16.2 Priority of Relief

16.2.1 Platform restoration is **critical** because:
- Stops ongoing R97,000/day theft
- Preserves evidence for prosecution
- Enables business recovery
- Prevents further customer fraud
- Protects remaining assets

16.2.2 Every day of delay causes **irreversible harm** and potential permanent evidence loss.

---

### 17. PRAYERS FOR RELIEF

In addition to the relief sought in the main rescission affidavit, I respectfully pray that this Honourable Court:

17.1 **Order immediate platform access restoration** within 48 hours:
- Shopify platform full access
- Company email systems
- Domain controls
- Financial systems
- Customer databases

17.2 **Order audit trail recovery** from Shopify backups:
- All deleted data from 22 May 2025
- Forensic preservation
- Prohibition on further deletions

17.3 **Order Adderory account freeze**:
- All bank accounts frozen
- All transactions prohibited
- All records preserved

17.4 **Appoint forensic investigator** to:
- Quantify theft
- Trace revenue flows
- Examine evidence destruction
- Prepare criminal referral

17.5 **Terminate Rynette's access** to all RegimA systems immediately.

17.6 **Refer matter** for criminal investigation and prosecution.

17.7 Grant such **further and/or alternative relief** as the Court deems fit.

---

### 18. CONCLUSION

18.1 The evidence proves:
- UK owns the Shopify platform (R677K+ invested)
- Peter's claim that "UK owes SA" is false
- Rynette has hijacked R14.5M+ in revenue
- Evidence was systematically destroyed
- The Interdict enables and protects this criminal enterprise

18.2 Urgent intervention is required to:
- Stop ongoing theft (R97,000/day)
- Preserve evidence (risk of further destruction)
- Enable recovery and restitution
- Protect customers from fraud
- Facilitate criminal prosecution

18.3 Every day of delay causes irreversible harm and potential permanent evidence loss.

18.4 Justice requires immediate relief.
