## Legal Grounds

### Three Independent Grounds for Setting Aside Interdict

**Ground 1: Bad Faith / Clean Hands Violation**
- Peter created the problems he complains about
- Card cancellations created documentation gap
- System restrictions prevented record retrieval
- Violates clean hands doctrine, bars equitable relief

**Annexures:** JF-TIMELINE, JF-CAUSATION, JF-DAN-WITNESS

---

**Ground 2: Material Non-Disclosure**
- Peter failed to disclose Jax's Responsible Person role (37 jurisdictions)
- Peter failed to disclose disproportionate harm (R68M+ vs R500K)
- Peter failed to disclose his own conduct creating the problems
- Violates ex parte duty of utmost good faith
- Interdict void ab initio

**Annexures:** JF-DISPROP, JF-REBUTTAL-MATRIX

---

**Ground 3: Gross Disproportionality**
- Alleged harm: R500,000 (reversible)
- Interdict-caused harm: R68,141,647.70+ (largely irreversible)
- Harm ratio: 36:1 (financial only) to 136:1 (including regulatory)
- Violates constitutional proportionality (Section 36)
- Relief causes greater harm than it prevents

**Annexures:** JF-DISPROP

## Why This Matters

**Civil Response Success = Criminal Case Access**

Setting aside the interdict is **critical** because:
1. Restores access to company systems and records
2. Enables evidence gathering for criminal case
3. Stops ongoing harm (R68M+ and growing)
4. Restores Jax's ability to fulfill Responsible Person duties
5. Prevents criminal liability exposure

**Without civil success:** Cannot access company records needed for criminal prosecution

**With civil success:** Full access to 8 years of emails, financial records, transaction logs, system access logs - everything needed to prosecute Peter, Rynette, and Bantjes

---

## Next Steps After Filing

**Week 1-2:** Court hearing, interdict set aside  
**Week 2-12:** Criminal evidence gathering (see `/2-CRIMINAL-CASE/`)  
**Week 12+:** Criminal complaint filing and prosecution
