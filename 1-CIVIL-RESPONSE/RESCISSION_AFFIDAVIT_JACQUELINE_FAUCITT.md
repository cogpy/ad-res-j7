## JACQUELINE FAUCITT (FIRST RESPONDENT)

---

## IN THE HIGH COURT OF SOUTH AFRICA
## GAUTENG DIVISION, PRETORIA

**Case Number**: 2025-137857

---

**In the matter between**:

**PETER ANDREW FAUCITT** - Applicant

and

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT** - First Respondent

**DANIEL JAMES FAUCITT** - Second Respondent

**[Additional Respondents as per Court Application]**

---

## ANSWERING AFFIDAVIT
## APPLICATION TO SET ASIDE EX PARTE INTERDICT

I, the undersigned,

**JACQUELINE FAUCITT**

do hereby make oath and state:

---

## PART A: PRELIMINARY MATTERS

### 1. INTRODUCTION AND LOCUS STANDI

#### 1.1 Identity and Capacity

1.1.1 I am an adult female, South African citizen, with identity number **[ID NUMBER]**.

1.1.2 I am the First Respondent in this matter.

1.1.3 I am the mother of both the Applicant (Peter Andrew Faucitt) and the Second Respondent (Daniel James Faucitt).

1.1.4 I am a director of **RegimA Worldwide Distribution (Pty) Ltd** (Registration: 2011/005722/07), together with the Applicant and the Second Respondent.

1.1.5 I have personal knowledge of the facts deposed to in this affidavit, save where the context indicates otherwise, and I am competent to depose to same.

1.1.6 Where I make legal submissions, I do so on the advice of my legal representatives.

#### 1.2 Purpose of This Affidavit

1.2.1 This affidavit is filed to apply for the rescission of the ex parte interdict granted on **19 August 2025** (the "Interdict").

1.2.2 I seek the setting aside of the Interdict in its entirety for the reasons set out herein.

1.2.3 This affidavit demonstrates that the Interdict should be set aside on **three independent grounds**, each of which is sufficient on its own to warrant rescission.

#### 1.3 Structure of This Affidavit

1.3.1 This affidavit is structured as follows:
- **Part A**: Preliminary matters and introduction
- **Part B**: Ground 1 - Material Non-Disclosure (void ab initio)
- **Part C**: Ground 2 - False Factual Premises
- **Part D**: Ground 3 - Gross Disproportionality
- **Part E**: Relief sought

1.3.2 I rely on supporting annexures marked "**JF-RP1**" through "**JF-CUI-BONO**", which contain comprehensive documentary evidence supporting this application.

---

### 2. OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION

#### 2.1 Three Independent Grounds

2.1.1 The Interdict must be set aside because:
- **Ground 1**: The Applicant failed to make material disclosures required in ex parte applications, rendering the Interdict void ab initio
- **Ground 2**: The Interdict is based on factually incorrect premises that cannot support the relief granted
- **Ground 3**: The Interdict is grossly disproportionate, causing harm 136 times greater than the concern it addresses

2.1.2 Each ground is independently sufficient to set aside the Interdict. The Court need only find one ground established to grant the relief sought.

#### 2.2 Expected Outcome

2.2.1 Based on the evidence presented, I respectfully submit that:
- The Interdict should be set aside with immediate effect
- Costs should be awarded on an attorney-and-client scale
- The matter should be referred for criminal investigation

---

## PART B: GROUND 1 - MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE

### 3. LEGAL PRINCIPLE: UBERRIMA FIDES

#### 3.1 The Duty of Utmost Good Faith

3.1.1 Ex parte applications require **uberrima fides** (utmost good faith). An applicant must place before the Court all material facts, whether favorable or unfavorable to the application.

3.1.2 Material non-disclosure renders an ex parte order void ab initio, regardless of whether disclosure would have changed the outcome.

3.1.3 The duty extends to all facts that a reasonable court would consider material to its decision.

#### 3.2 Eight Categories of Material Non-Disclosure

3.2.1 The Applicant failed to disclose eight categories of material facts, creating a systematic pattern of misleading the Court.

3.2.2 Each category alone constitutes material non-disclosure sufficient to set aside the Interdict.

---

### 4. NON-DISCLOSURE 1: RESPONSIBLE PERSON REGULATORY CRISIS

#### 4.1 What Peter Failed to Disclose

4.1.1 I am legally designated as the **Responsible Person** for cosmetic products in **37 jurisdictions** worldwide.

4.1.2 Under EU Regulation 1223/2009 and equivalent international regulations, the Responsible Person bears non-delegable personal duties including:
- Product safety assessments
- Regulatory compliance monitoring
- Incident reporting
- Product information file maintenance
- Market surveillance cooperation

4.1.3 The Interdict **prevents me from performing these legal obligations** by denying access to company systems, product databases, and regulatory documentation.

4.1.4 This creates immediate regulatory non-compliance with potential consequences including:
- Personal criminal liability
- Regulatory penalties exceeding **R50 million**
- Product recalls across 37 jurisdictions
- Market withdrawal orders
- Import/export bans

#### 4.2 Evidence

4.2.1 **Annexure JF-RP1**: Regulatory appointment letters from 37 jurisdictions, Cosmetic Product Notification Portal (CPNP) registrations, and Product Information Files (PIFs).

4.2.2 **Annexure JF-RP2**: Regulatory risk analysis prepared by compliance consultants, quantifying exposure at R50M+ in potential penalties.

4.2.3 Legal Authority: EU Regulation 1223/2009, equivalent regulations in 36 other jurisdictions.

#### 4.3 Materiality

4.3.1 Had the Court known that the Interdict would:
- Prevent compliance with legal obligations
- Create personal criminal liability exposure
- Risk R50M+ in regulatory penalties
- Force regulatory non-compliance across 37 jurisdictions

the Interdict would not have been granted.

4.3.2 No court would grant relief that forces a person into criminal non-compliance with regulatory duties.

---

### 5. NON-DISCLOSURE 2: SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TIMING

#### 5.1 What Peter Failed to Disclose

5.1.1 A settlement agreement was signed **8 days before the Interdict application** on **11 August 2025**.

5.1.2 The Interdict application was filed **2 days after the settlement agreement** on **13 August 2025**.

5.1.3 The Applicant provided no explanation for the sudden "urgency" immediately after reaching a settlement.

5.1.4 The timing demonstrates strategic litigation positioning, not genuine emergency.

#### 5.2 Evidence

5.2.1 **Annexure JF5**: Settlement agreement dated 11 August 2025.

5.2.2 **Timeline Analysis**: Settlement (11 Aug) → 2 days → Interdict filing (13 Aug) → 6 days → Interdict granted (19 Aug).

5.2.3 Court filing stamps proving the timing sequence.

#### 5.3 Materiality

5.3.1 The timing negates the Applicant's claim of urgency.

5.3.2 If there was genuine urgency, why was settlement pursued instead of immediate court intervention?

5.3.3 The proximity of settlement to interdict filing suggests the settlement created the "urgency" (by failing to achieve desired control), not any business emergency.

---

### 6. NON-DISCLOSURE 3: INVESTMENT PAYOUT TIMING

#### 6.1 What Peter Failed to Disclose

6.1.1 A major investment payout of **R18 million** is due in **May 2026**, nine months after the Interdict.

6.1.2 The Interdict positions the Applicant for control immediately before this major financial event.

6.1.3 The financial motive for seizing control at this specific time was not disclosed.

6.1.4 The timing demonstrates long-term strategic planning, contradicting claims of urgent emergency.

#### 6.2 Evidence

6.2.1 **Annexure JF-INVESTMENT1**: Investment documentation showing May 2026 payout date.

6.2.2 **Timeline Analysis**: Interdict (Aug 2025) → 9 months → R18M Payout (May 2026).

6.2.3 Trust deed showing Applicant's accountant (Bantjies) as trustee with control over distribution.

#### 6.3 Materiality

6.3.1 The R18M payout provides clear financial motive for the Interdict.

6.3.2 The timing reveals strategic positioning for control before a major financial event.

6.3.3 This fundamentally contradicts the narrative of emergency response to discovered misconduct.

---

### 7. NON-DISCLOSURE 4: PETER'S OWN DISRUPTIVE ACTIONS

#### 7.1 What Peter Failed to Disclose

7.1.1 On **7 June 2025**, the Applicant **unilaterally cancelled all business bank cards** without notice to co-directors.

7.1.2 This action:
- Terminated access to cloud-based documentation systems
- Prevented retrieval of historical financial records
- Created the documentation gap the Applicant now complains about
- Restricted co-directors' ability to perform their duties

7.1.3 The Applicant transferred control to non-director bookkeeper (Rynette Farrar), giving her system access exceeding that of directors.

7.1.4 **The Applicant created the problems he now uses to justify the Interdict**.

#### 7.2 Evidence

7.2.1 **Annexure JF-CAUSATION**: Comprehensive analysis showing how card cancellations created the documentation crisis.

7.2.2 **Annexure JF-SYSTEM-ACCESS**: System logs showing the Applicant restricted director access while expanding Rynette's access.

7.2.3 **Timeline**: Card cancellation (7 June) → Documentation gap emerges → Applicant complains about gap (July-Aug).

#### 7.3 Legal Principle: Unclean Hands

7.3.1 The Applicant comes to Court with "unclean hands" - he created the problems he now seeks relief for.

7.3.2 Equity will not assist a party who has created the mischief complained of.

7.3.3 This violates fundamental principles of equity and bars the relief sought.

#### 7.4 Materiality

7.4.1 Had the Court known the Applicant:
- Created the documentation problems through his own actions
- Restricted co-directors' access to company systems
- Transferred control to a non-director
- Now seeks to benefit from problems he created

the Interdict would not have been granted.

---

### 8. NON-DISCLOSURE 5: DIRECTOR LOAN ACCOUNT STRUCTURE

#### 8.1 What Peter Failed to Disclose

8.1.1 The companies owe directors **millions in accumulated director loans**.

8.1.2 The R500,000 payment characterized as an "unauthorized gift" was actually a **partial repayment** of money the company owed to me through my director loan account.

8.1.3 **The Applicant has made identical withdrawals** using the same director loan account practice for over 20 years.

8.1.4 This is an established practice spanning decades, participated in by all directors including the Applicant.

#### 8.2 Evidence

8.2.1 **Annexure JF-DLA1**: The Applicant's director loan account showing his own withdrawals using identical practice.

8.2.2 **Annexure JF-DLA2**: My director loan account showing the company owes me R[X] million, making the R500K a partial repayment.

8.2.3 **Annexure JF-DLA3**: Daniel's director loan account.

8.2.4 **Annexures JF-PA1 to JF-PA4**: Minimum four examples of the Applicant's identical withdrawals over the years.

#### 8.3 Legal Characterization

8.3.1 Under company law and accounting principles:
- Signatory authority + accounting allocation + established practice = authorized transaction
- Payment against a credit balance in a director loan account is not a "gift" but debt repayment
- The Applicant cannot characterize as "unauthorized" what he himself has done for 20+ years

#### 8.4 Materiality

8.4.1 The entire premise of "unauthorized gift" collapses when the Court understands:
- The R500K was repayment of company debt
- The practice was established and participated in by the Applicant
- The Applicant made identical withdrawals himself
- The transaction had proper accounting treatment

8.4.2 Had the Court known these facts, the "unauthorized gift" allegation would have been rejected and the Interdict denied.

---

### 9. NON-DISCLOSURE 6: HISTORICAL COLLABORATIVE BUSINESS MODEL

#### 9.1 What Peter Failed to Disclose

9.1.1 For over **20 years**, the family businesses operated on an informal, collaborative model.

9.1.2 The Applicant participated in and never objected to these practices during this entire period.

9.1.3 The sudden characterization of long-established practices as "misconduct" coincides with:
- The upcoming R18M investment payout
- Settlement negotiations that didn't achieve desired control
- Strategic positioning for financial gain

9.1.4 It is hypocritical and inequitable for the Applicant to now challenge practices he engaged in and benefited from for decades.

#### 9.2 Evidence

9.2.1 **Annexure JF-HIST1**: Historical emails showing collaborative decision-making.

9.2.2 **Annexure JF-HIST2**: Examples of the Applicant's participation in informal practices.

9.2.3 **Annexure JF-HIST3**: Historical financial records showing established patterns.

#### 9.3 Materiality

9.3.1 The Court was led to believe the practices were new misconduct requiring urgent intervention.

9.3.2 Had the Court known these were decades-old practices the Applicant participated in, the urgency claim would have failed.

---

### 10. NON-DISCLOSURE 7: DISPROPORTIONATE HARM

#### 10.1 What Peter Failed to Disclose

10.1.1 The Interdict causes **documented harm exceeding R68 million**:
- Direct business losses: R18.1M+
- Regulatory penalties exposure: R50M+
- Personal criminal liability exposure
- Irreversible damage to international operations

10.1.2 The Applicant's alleged concern: **R500,000** (and this is not even truly at risk, as shown above).

10.1.3 **Harm ratio: 136:1** - the remedy is 136 times worse than the alleged disease.

#### 10.2 Evidence

10.2.1 **Annexure JF-HARM-ANALYSIS**: Complete financial impact analysis showing:
- R18.1M+ in direct business losses
- R50M+ in regulatory exposure
- R68M+ total documented harm
- Detailed breakdown by category and jurisdiction

10.2.2 Comparison table: R68M harm vs R500K concern = 136:1 ratio.

#### 10.3 Legal Principle: Proportionality

10.3.1 Under Section 36 of the Constitution and common law principles, relief must be proportionate to the harm it prevents.

10.3.2 Relief that causes harm 136 times greater than it prevents violates constitutional proportionality.

10.3.3 Such gross disproportion demonstrates ulterior motive, not legitimate concern.

#### 10.4 Materiality

10.4.1 No court would grant relief causing R68M+ harm to prevent R500K of alleged (but not actual) risk.

10.4.2 Had the Court known the true harm ratio, the Interdict would have been denied as grossly disproportionate.

---

### 11. NON-DISCLOSURE 8: TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO NON-DIRECTOR

#### 11.1 What Peter Failed to Disclose

11.1.1 The Applicant transferred **unprecedented control** to Rynette Farrar, a non-director bookkeeper.

11.1.2 No board resolution authorized this transfer of control.

11.1.3 Rynette was given system access **exceeding that of directors**, including:
- Bank account control
- Password access to all company systems
- Authority to sign bank authorization forms
- Control over financial records

11.1.4 The Applicant characterizes **director oversight** as "interference" while defending **non-director control** as appropriate.

#### 11.2 Evidence

11.2.1 **Annexure JF-RF1**: Email from Applicant granting Rynette system access.

11.2.2 **Annexure JF-RF2**: Email from Applicant providing passwords to Rynette.

11.2.3 **Annexure JF-RF3**: Bank authorization forms signed by Rynette.

11.2.4 Comparison: Directors excluded, non-director given full control.

#### 11.3 Materiality

11.3.1 The Court was led to believe the Applicant was protecting proper corporate governance.

11.3.2 Had the Court known he transferred control to a non-director while excluding directors, the governance concern would have been exposed as pretextual.

---

### 12. SUMMARY - MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE

#### 12.1 Pattern of Systematic Misleading

12.1.1 The eight categories of non-disclosure demonstrate a **systematic pattern** of misleading the Court.

12.1.2 This is not inadvertent omission but deliberate presentation of a false narrative.

12.1.3 The cumulative effect shows the Court was fundamentally misled about:
- The nature of the transactions (debt repayment, not gift)
- The urgency (strategic timing, not emergency)
- The harm balance (136:1 disproportion)
- The Applicant's own conduct (created the problems)
- The regulatory consequences (R50M+ exposure)
- The financial motives (R18M payout positioning)

#### 12.2 Legal Consequence

12.2.1 **Any one** of the eight non-disclosures is sufficient to set aside the Interdict.

12.2.2 The **pattern** of systematic non-disclosure demonstrates bad faith and justifies costs on attorney-and-client scale.

12.2.3 The **cumulative effect** warrants referral for investigation of potential abuse of process.

12.2.4 **Legal consequence**: The Interdict is void ab initio and must be set aside.

---

## PART C: GROUND 2 - FALSE FACTUAL PREMISES

### 13. OVERVIEW - FACTUALLY INCORRECT FOUNDATIONS

13.1 Even if the Applicant had disclosed everything (which he did not), the Interdict should be set aside because the underlying factual premises are false.

13.2 The Interdict is based on two core factual claims, both of which are demonstrably incorrect:
- The R500K was an "unauthorized gift"
- Daniel's UK entities owe money to SA operations

13.3 Both claims are the exact opposite of documented reality.

---

### 14. FALSE PREMISE 1: THE R500K "UNAUTHORIZED GIFT"

#### 14.1 The Applicant's Claim

14.1.1 The Applicant characterizes the R500K payment as an "unauthorized gift" requiring urgent intervention.

#### 14.2 The Truth

14.2.1 The R500K was **authorized** through:
- Signatory authority (proper bank authorization)
- Accounting allocation (to director loan account)
- Established practice (20+ years of identical transactions)

14.2.2 The R500K was a **director loan account repayment**, not a gift:
- The company owes me millions through accumulated director loans
- The R500K represents partial repayment of this debt
- Repayment of a company debt cannot be characterized as a "gift"

14.2.3 The R500K represents **established practice**:
- All directors have made identical withdrawals for 20+ years
- The Applicant himself made identical withdrawals
- The practice was known to and accepted by all parties
- Sudden objection coincides with strategic timing (settlement + R18M payout)

#### 14.3 Evidence

14.3.1 **Annexure JF-BS1**: Bank statement dated 16 July 2025 showing the payment with proper signatory authorization.

14.3.2 **Annexure JF-DLA2**: My director loan account ledger showing the company owes me R[X] million, making the R500K a debt repayment.

14.3.3 **Annexure JF-AR1**: Accounting records showing allocation to director loan account (not to "gifts" or "drawings").

14.3.4 **Annexures JF-PA1 to JF-PA4**: Minimum four examples of the Applicant's own identical withdrawals over the years.

#### 14.4 Legal Analysis

14.4.1 Under company law and accounting principles:
- A payment with signatory authority is authorized
- Allocation to director loan account confirms accounting treatment
- Established practice creates legitimate expectation
- Repayment of director loan is not a "gift"

14.4.2 The Applicant cannot:
- Characterize as "unauthorized" what he himself authorized through established practice
- Characterize as "gift" what is properly treated as loan account repayment
- Object to practices he participated in for decades

#### 14.5 Conclusion

14.5.1 The core allegation of "unauthorized gift" is factually false.

14.5.2 Without this false premise, the Interdict has no foundation.

---

### 15. FALSE PREMISE 2: THE "UK OWES SA" CLAIM

#### 15.1 The Applicant's Claim

15.1.1 The Applicant claims that Daniel's UK entities owe money to the SA operations.

#### 15.2 The Truth - Exact Opposite

15.2.1 The **payment direction is UK → SA**, not SA → UK.

15.2.2 Daniel's UK entity (RegimA Zone Ltd) **owns and pays for the Shopify e-commerce platform** used by SA operations.

15.2.3 Over **8 years**, UK cards paid **R677,288+** for the Shopify platform:
- RegimA SA (25 stores): UK card 5191/1927 paid R328,432
- RegimA Zone (26 stores): UK card 5225/3212 paid R348,856
- RegimA Worldwide: UK card 7147 paid subscriptions

15.2.4 Under creditor/debtor law: **UK is the creditor**, SA is the debtor.

#### 15.3 Evidence - Third-Party Documentation

15.3.1 **Annexure DF4**: 26+ Shopify invoices for RegimA SA showing UK card payments totaling R328,432 over 8 years.

15.3.2 **Annexure DF5**: 26+ Shopify invoices for RegimA Zone showing UK card payments totaling R348,856 over 8 years.

15.3.3 **Annexure DF6**: Shopify invoices for RegimA Worldwide showing UK card payments.

15.3.4 **Payment Flow Analysis**: All documented payments flow UK → SA, proving UK funded the platform.

#### 15.4 Legal Implications

15.4.1 The UK entity has **superior legal claim** as platform owner and funder:
- UK invested R677K+ in platform development
- SA operations generated revenue using UK-owned platform
- UK never invoiced SA for platform usage
- This creates unjust enrichment by SA

15.4.2 The Applicant's claim that "UK owes SA" is the **exact opposite** of documented reality.

#### 15.5 RegimA Worldwide Bank Accounts Explanation

15.5.1 RegimA Worldwide Distribution acts as a **distribution aggregator**:
- Does NOT hold stock
- Does NOT own sales channels
- Flows held in trust for beneficiaries

15.5.2 Like any business intelligence system (such as SAP or RegimA SA):
- Aggregation does not equal ownership
- Annual accounts allocate income/expenditure to proper entities
- Multiple Shopify instances for different distribution channels

15.5.3 This is standard practice in multi-jurisdictional operations.

---

### 16. COUNTER-CLAIM: UNJUST ENRICHMENT

#### 16.1 The Real Issue

16.1.1 RegimA Worldwide Distribution generated **R2.94M - R6.88M** in revenue using Daniel's UK-owned platform.

16.1.2 The platform owner (RegimA Zone Ltd UK) was **never paid** for platform usage.

16.1.3 This constitutes unjust enrichment: **R140K - R280K+** in unpaid platform costs.

#### 16.2 The Applicant's Hypocrisy

16.2.1 The Applicant questions R500K with proper authorization and accounting treatment.

16.2.2 While simultaneously enabling millions in revenue generated using a platform never paid for.

16.2.3 While the UK entity that funded the platform has superior creditor claims.

#### 16.3 Conclusion

16.3.1 The Applicant's debt claim is factually incorrect.

16.3.2 The reality is the opposite: SA operations are indebted to UK, not vice versa.

---

### 17. SUMMARY - FALSE FACTUAL PREMISES

17.1 Both core premises of the Interdict are factually false:
- R500K was authorized, not unauthorized
- R500K was debt repayment, not gift
- UK is creditor, not debtor
- Payment direction is UK → SA, not SA → UK

17.2 Even with full disclosure (which was not made), the Interdict fails on the facts.

17.3 A court order based on false factual premises must be set aside.

---

## PART D: GROUND 3 - GROSS DISPROPORTIONALITY

### 18. CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE: PROPORTIONALITY

#### 18.1 Legal Framework

18.1.1 Under Section 36 of the Constitution and common law principles, any limitation of rights must be **proportionate** to the legitimate objective pursued.

18.1.2 Relief must not cause harm substantially greater than the harm it prevents.

18.1.3 Gross disproportion between harm caused and harm prevented demonstrates:
- Ulterior motive
- Abuse of process
- Constitutional violation

#### 18.2 The Disproportion in This Case

18.2.1 The disproportion in this case is **extreme and unprecedented**:

| Metric | Applicant's Concern | Actual Harm from Interdict | Ratio |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| Amount | R500,000 | R68,141,648+ | 136:1 |
| Urgency | Waited 2 months | Immediate regulatory crisis | Inverse |
| Reversibility | Fully reversible | Largely irreversible | Infinite |
| Benefit to Peter | None (exposed to R110M+ liability) | None | N/A |

---

### 19. BREAKDOWN OF R68M+ HARM

#### 19.1 Direct Business Losses: R18.1M+

19.1.1 Revenue losses from operational disruption
19.1.2 Customer losses from service interruptions
19.1.3 Contract penalties and breaches
19.1.4 Market share erosion

**Evidence**: Annexure JF-HARM-ANALYSIS, section 1.

#### 19.2 Regulatory Exposure: R50M+

19.2.1 As Responsible Person in 37 jurisdictions, I face:
- Personal criminal liability for non-compliance
- Regulatory penalties across multiple jurisdictions
- Product recall costs
- Market withdrawal damages
- Legal defense costs

19.2.2 The Interdict **forces** regulatory non-compliance by preventing access to systems required for legal duties.

**Evidence**: Annexure JF-HARM-ANALYSIS, section 2; Annexure JF-RP2 (regulatory risk analysis).

#### 19.3 Additional Harms

19.3.1 Personal financial bleeding: R100,000/month paid from personal funds
19.3.2 Irreversible reputation damage
19.3.3 Permanent loss of business relationships
19.3.4 Strategic opportunities foreclosed

**Evidence**: Annexure JF-HARM-ANALYSIS, section 3.

---

### 20. APPLICANT'S ALLEGED CONCERN: R500K

#### 20.1 The R500K Is Not Actually at Risk

20.1.1 As demonstrated above, the R500K was:
- Properly authorized
- Allocated to director loan account
- Repayment of company debt to me
- Part of established 20-year practice

20.1.2 Even if the Applicant's characterization were correct (which it is not), the R500K is **fully reversible** through accounting adjustments.

20.1.3 There is no actual R500K at risk - this is manufactured concern.

#### 20.2 The Applicant Has Not Benefited

20.2.1 The Interdict does not protect the Applicant - it exposes him to liability.

20.2.2 As co-director, the Applicant is jointly and severally liable for regulatory non-compliance caused by the Interdict.

20.2.3 Estimated exposure to the Applicant: **R110M+** in potential liability.

20.2.4 The Interdict harms the Applicant more than it could possibly benefit him.

---

### 21. THE 136:1 HARM RATIO

#### 21.1 Unprecedented Disproportion

21.1.1 A remedy that causes harm **136 times greater** than the concern it addresses is:
- Grossly disproportionate
- Constitutionally impermissible
- Evidence of ulterior motive
- Abuse of process

21.1.2 No legitimate concern could justify such extreme disproportion.

#### 21.2 The Urgency Inversion

21.2.1 The Applicant's "urgency":
- Waited 2 months after alleged "discovery"
- Filed 2 days after settlement agreement
- Nine months before R18M payout
- Strategic timing, not emergency

21.2.2 The actual urgency:
- Immediate regulatory non-compliance
- Daily accumulating penalties
- Irreversible business damage
- R3,333/day personal bleeding

21.2.3 The urgency is **inverted** - the real emergency is the harm caused by the Interdict, not the manufactured concern that justified it.

---

### 22. PATTERN: POSITIONING FOR FINANCIAL CONTROL

#### 22.1 Timeline Analysis

All positioning occurs in run-up to major financial event:

| Date | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| July 2024 | Bantjies appointed trustee | Position control over R18M payout |
| 11 Aug 2025 | Settlement agreement | Attempt to gain control via agreement |
| 13 Aug 2025 | Interdict filed | Alternative route when settlement insufficient |
| 19 Aug 2025 | Interdict granted | Control achieved |
| Oct 2025 | Medical testing scheduled | Position for incapacity findings |
| May 2026 | R18M payout | Financial objective achieved |

#### 22.2 Cui Bono Analysis

22.2.1 **Who benefits from the Interdict?**

NOT Peter (exposed to R110M+ liability)
NOT the companies (R68M+ harm)
NOT the family (destroyed relationships)

ONLY Bantjies (as trustee, controls R18M if we're incapacitated)
ONLY Rynette (continues revenue theft undetected)

**Evidence**: Annexure JF-CUI-BONO (detailed financial benefit analysis).

---

### 23. CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION

#### 23.1 Section 36 Analysis

23.1.1 The Interdict constitutes a limitation of rights:
- Right to conduct business
- Right to perform legal duties
- Right to access property (company systems)
- Right to dignity (forced regulatory non-compliance)

23.1.2 The limitation is not justifiable under Section 36 because:
- The purpose is not legitimate (false premises)
- The means are not rational (136:1 disproportion)
- The harm caused vastly exceeds any benefit
- Less restrictive means were available but not disclosed

23.1.3 The limitation is therefore unconstitutional.

---

### 24. SUMMARY - GROSS DISPROPORTIONALITY

24.1 The harm caused by the Interdict (R68M+) is 136 times greater than the alleged concern (R500K).

24.2 This extreme disproportion:
- Violates constitutional proportionality
- Demonstrates ulterior motive
- Proves the stated concern is pretextual
- Constitutes abuse of process

24.3 The pattern of timing shows the true purpose: positioning for control before R18M payout.

## PART E: RELIEF SOUGHT

### 25. PRAYERS FOR RELIEF

I respectfully pray that this Honourable Court:

25.1 **Set aside** the ex parte interdict granted on 19 August 2025 with immediate effect;

25.2 **Award costs** to the Respondents on an attorney-and-client scale;

25.3 **Refer** the matter for investigation of potential:
- Abuse of process
- Material misrepresentation to Court
- Contempt of Court

25.4 Grant such **further and/or alternative relief** as the Court deems fit.

---

### 26. CONCLUSION

26.1 The Interdict must be set aside on any one of three independent grounds:
- Material non-disclosure (void ab initio)
- False factual premises (no merit)
- Gross disproportionality (constitutional violation)

26.2 Each ground is independently sufficient. The cumulative effect is overwhelming.

26.3 The evidence demonstrates systematic misleading of the Court, bad faith application, and abuse of process.

26.4 Justice requires immediate setting aside of the Interdict with costs on attorney-and-client scale.
