## Main Affidavits

### 1. RESCISSION_AFFIDAVIT_JACQUELINE_FAUCITT.md
**Primary Affidavit - Rescission Application**

**Deponent**: Jacqueline Faucitt (First Respondent)

**Purpose**: Main affidavit applying to set aside the ex parte interdict

**Structure**:
- **Part A**: Preliminary Matters
- **Part B**: Ground 1 - Material Non-Disclosure (8 categories)
- **Part C**: Ground 2 - False Factual Premises
- **Part D**: Ground 3 - Gross Disproportionality
- **Part E**: Relief Sought

**Key Arguments**:

**Ground 1: Material Non-Disclosure (Void Ab Initio)**
1. Responsible Person regulatory crisis (R50M+ exposure, 37 jurisdictions)
2. Settlement agreement timing (8 days before interdict)
3. Investment payout timing (R18M, May 2026)
4. Peter's own disruptive actions (created problems he complains about)
5. Director loan account structure (R500K was debt repayment, not gift)
6. Historical collaborative business model (20+ years)
7. Disproportionate harm (R68M+ vs R500K = 136:1)
8. Transfer of control to non-director (Rynette Farrar)

**Ground 2: False Factual Premises**
- R500K was authorized (signatory authority + accounting allocation + established practice)
- R500K was director loan repayment (not gift)
- UK owns platform (not owes SA) - R677K+ invested
- Payment direction UK → SA (documented in Shopify invoices)

**Ground 3: Gross Disproportionality (Constitutional Violation)**
- Harm caused: R68,141,648+ (136 times alleged concern)
- Alleged concern: R500,000 (not even truly at risk)
- Urgency inverted (waited 2 months, strategic timing)
- Violates Section 36 constitutional proportionality

### 2. SUPPORTING_AFFIDAVIT_RYNETTE_SHOPIFY_EVIDENCE.md
**Supporting Affidavit - Platform Ownership & Revenue Hijacking**

**Deponent**: Daniel James Faucitt (Second Respondent)

**Purpose**: Prove UK platform ownership and document ongoing revenue theft by Rynette Farrar

**Structure**:
- **Part A**: Preliminary Matters
- **Part B**: Platform Ownership Evidence (UK owns Shopify infrastructure)
- **Part C**: Revenue Hijacking by Rynette Farrar
- **Part D**: Criminal Enterprise Analysis
- **Part E**: Relief Required

**Key Evidence**:

**Platform Ownership (UK owns, not owes)**:

- DF5: RegimA Zone Shopify invoices (26 stores, R348,856 paid by UK card 5225/3212)
- DF6: RegimA Worldwide Shopify invoices (paid by UK card 7147)
- **Total UK investment**: R677,288+ over 8 years
- **Payment direction**: UK → SA (proves UK is creditor, not debtor)
- JF1: Shopify Plus email (26 July 2017) - forensic time capsule

**Revenue Hijacking Timeline**:
- 15 May 2025: Jax confronts Rynette → **Trigger event**
- 22 May 2025 (7 days later): Shopify audit trail destruction
- 29 May 2025 (14 days later): Domain appropriation (regimaskin.co.za to Adderory)
- 14 April 2025: Bank account changes redirect revenue
- June-Oct 2025: Ongoing revenue theft (R14.5M+)

**Criminal Enterprise**:
- Adderory companies registered April 2021 (Rynette's son)

- Evidence destruction (22 May 2025, all Shopify audit trails deleted)
- Customer revenue redirection (R97,000/day theft)

### 3. SUPPORTING_AFFIDAVIT_BANTJIES_MEDICAL_TESTING.md
**Supporting Affidavit - Trustee Conflict & Medical Testing Manipulation Risk**

**Deponent**: Jacqueline Faucitt (First Respondent)

**Purpose**: Document Bantjies' conflicts of interest and prevent medical testing manipulation for R18M control

**Structure**:
- **Part A**: Preliminary Matters
- **Part B**: The Conflict of Interest Problem (Bantjies' 4 roles)
- **Part C**: The Medical Testing Manipulation Risk
- **Part D**: The R18M Payout at Stake
- **Part E**: Timeline Analysis Showing Coordination
- **Part F**: Relief Required

**The Four Conflicting Roles**:
1. **Company Accountant** (controls financial narrative)
2. **Trustee** (controls R18M distribution)
3. **Commissioner of Oaths** (can certify documents)
4. **Peter's Ally** (provided false confirmatory affidavit)

**The Manipulation Scenario**:
1. Psychiatric evaluation (Oct 2025, 7 months before R18M payout)
2. Bantjies provides misleading "financial information" to psychiatrist
3. Psychiatrist relies on Bantjies' "professional opinion"
4. Report finds "financial mismanagement" or "impaired judgment"
5. Report recommends "treatment" or "curatorship"
6. Bantjies certifies implementation documents (as Commissioner of Oaths)
7. Dan & Jax incapacitated → Cannot challenge Bantjies' control
8. Bantjies distributes R18M as he sees fit (May 2026), no oversight

**Timing Pattern**:
- July 2024: Bantjies appointed trustee (control mechanism)
- 11 Aug 2025: Settlement agreement (medical testing clause manipulated)
- 13 Aug 2025: Interdict filed (Bantjies provides false affidavit)
- Oct 2025: Medical testing scheduled (7 months before payout)
- May 2026: R18M payout (financial objective)

**Cui Bono Analysis**:
- NOT Peter (R110M+ liability exposure)
- NOT companies (R68M+ harm)
- NOT family (relationships destroyed)
- **ONLY Bantjies** (controls R18M if we're incapacitated)

**Evidence Referenced**: JF-BANTJIES1, JF-BANTJIES2, JF-TRUST1, JF-INVESTMENT1, JF5-DRAFT, JF5-FINAL, JF5-COMPARISON, DJF, JF-CUI-BONO

**Mandatory Conditions for Medical Testing**:
- Bantjies removed as trustee OR complete recusal
- Independent interim trustee appointed
- No testing until AFTER May 2026 payout finalized
- Party control (not attorney control) over professional selection
- One-time evaluation only (no ongoing treatment)
- No automatic consequences (curatorship, restrictions)
- Right to refuse recommended treatments
- Independent verification of findings
- Testing costs from neutral source
- R18M distribution cannot be conditioned on testing

**Prayers**:
- Suspend Bantjies as trustee immediately
- Appoint independent interim trustee
- Preserve R18M investment
- Prohibit medical testing until after May 2026 payout
- Impose mandatory conditions if testing proceeds
- Protect R18M distribution from manipulation
- Forensic investigation of Bantjies
- Prohibit Bantjies from serving as Commissioner of Oaths for case matters

## Legal Strategy

### Three Independent Grounds

**Each ground is independently sufficient to set aside the interdict:**

1. **Material Non-Disclosure** → Interdict void ab initio
2. **False Factual Premises** → No merit to application
3. **Gross Disproportionality** → Constitutional violation

Court only needs to find ONE ground established to grant relief.

### Priority Evidence

**Lead with strongest third-party evidence:**
1. JF1 (Shopify Plus email) - proves independent operations
2. DF4/DF5/DF6 (Shopify invoices) - proves UK owns platform, payment direction UK → SA

These two pieces alone devastate Peter's narrative.

### Quantification Strategy

**Numbers are powerful:**
- R68M harm vs R500K concern = **136:1 ratio**
- R14.5M revenue theft (Rynette)
- R18M payout at risk (Bantjies)
- R100K/month personal bleeding
- R50M regulatory exposure
- R677K UK platform investment
- 7 days (confrontation → evidence destruction)
- 2 days (settlement → interdict)
- 7 months (medical testing → R18M payout)

### Pattern of Bad Faith

**Timeline demonstrates coordination:**
- Settlement (11 Aug) → Interdict (13 Aug) → Medical testing (Oct) → R18M payout (May 2026)
- Evidence destruction (22 May) = 7 days after confrontation
- Card cancellation → Documentation gap → Complain about gap
- "Has anything changed?" → "No" → Material changes made

**Pattern proves strategic litigation, not genuine concern.**

## Why This Matters

**Civil Response Success = Criminal Case Access**

Setting aside the interdict is **critical** because it:
1. Restores access to company systems and records
2. Enables evidence gathering for criminal case
3. Stops ongoing harm (R68M+ and growing daily)
4. Restores Jax's ability to fulfill Responsible Person duties
5. Prevents criminal liability exposure
6. Stops Rynette's ongoing revenue theft
7. Protects R18M payout from Bantjies manipulation

**Without civil success**: Cannot access evidence needed for criminal prosecution, R97K/day theft continues, R50M+ regulatory exposure accumulates.

**With civil success**: Full platform access, evidence preservation, theft stopped, criminal prosecution enabled.

---

## Next Steps After Rescission

**Week 1-2**: Court hearing, interdict set aside  
**Week 2-12**: Criminal evidence gathering (see `/2-CRIMINAL-CASE/`)  
**Week 12+**: Criminal complaint filing and prosecution
