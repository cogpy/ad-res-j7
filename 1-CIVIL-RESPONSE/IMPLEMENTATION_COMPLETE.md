---

## Deliverables Created

### 1. Main Rescission Affidavit (845 lines, 30KB)
**File**: `1-CIVIL-RESPONSE/RESCISSION_AFFIDAVIT_JACQUELINE_FAUCITT.md`

**Deponent**: Jacqueline Faucitt (First Respondent)

**Structure**:
- Part A: Preliminary Matters
- Part B: Ground 1 - Material Non-Disclosure (8 categories)
- Part C: Ground 2 - False Factual Premises
- Part D: Ground 3 - Gross Disproportionality
- Part E: Relief Sought

**Three Independent Grounds**:
1. **Material Non-Disclosure** (void ab initio) - 8 categories:
   - Responsible Person regulatory crisis (R50M+ exposure, 37 jurisdictions)
   - Settlement agreement timing (8 days before interdict)
   - Investment payout timing (R18M, May 2026)
   - Peter's own disruptive actions (unclean hands)
   - Director loan account structure (R500K was debt repayment)
   - Historical collaborative business model (20+ years)
   - Disproportionate harm (R68M+ vs R500K = 136:1)
   - Transfer of control to non-director (Rynette Farrar)

2. **False Factual Premises**:
   - R500K was authorized (signatory + accounting + practice)
   - UK owns platform (R677K invested, not owes SA)
   - Payment direction UK → SA (documented in Shopify invoices)

3. **Gross Disproportionality** (constitutional violation):
   - 136:1 harm ratio (R68M vs R500K)
   - Urgency inverted (waited 2 months)
   - Violates Section 36 proportionality

### 2. Rynette/Shopify Supporting Affidavit (800 lines, 25KB)
**File**: `1-CIVIL-RESPONSE/SUPPORTING_AFFIDAVIT_RYNETTE_SHOPIFY_EVIDENCE.md`

**Deponent**: Daniel James Faucitt (Second Respondent)

**Structure**:
- Part A: Preliminary Matters
- Part B: Platform Ownership Evidence
- Part C: Revenue Hijacking by Rynette Farrar
- Part D: Criminal Enterprise Analysis
- Part E: Relief Required

**Key Evidence**:
- **Platform Ownership**: DF4, DF5, DF6 (Shopify invoices, R677,288 UK investment)
- **Payment Direction**: UK → SA (proves UK is creditor, not debtor)
- **Revenue Hijacking Timeline**:
  - 15 May 2025: Jax confronts Rynette (trigger)
  - 22 May 2025: Shopify audit trail destruction (7 days later)
  - 29 May 2025: Domain appropriation regimaskin.co.za (14 days later)
  - 14 April 2025: Bank account changes
  - June-Oct 2025: R14.5M+ ongoing theft (R97K/day)

**Criminal Enterprise**:
- Adderory companies (April 2021 registration)
- Strategic Logistics destruction (pattern)
- Evidence destruction (22 May 2025)
- Customer revenue redirection
- Personal financial bleeding (R100K/month)

**Relief Sought**:

- Audit trail recovery from Shopify
- Adderory account freeze
- Forensic investigation
- Criminal referral

### 3. Bantjies/Medical Testing Supporting Affidavit (971 lines, 31KB)
**File**: `1-CIVIL-RESPONSE/SUPPORTING_AFFIDAVIT_BANTJIES_MEDICAL_TESTING.md`

**Deponent**: Jacqueline Faucitt (First Respondent)

**Structure**:
- Part A: Preliminary Matters
- Part B: The Conflict of Interest Problem
- Part C: The Medical Testing Manipulation Risk
- Part D: The R18M Payout at Stake
- Part E: Timeline Analysis
- Part F: Relief Required
- Part G: Integration with Main Application

**Four Conflicting Roles**:
1. Company Accountant (controls financial narrative)
2. Trustee (controls R18M distribution)
3. Commissioner of Oaths (can certify documents)
4. Peter's Ally (provided false confirmatory affidavit)

**8-Step Manipulation Scenario**:
1. Psychiatric evaluation (Oct 2025, 7 months before R18M payout)
2. Bantjies provides misleading financial information
3. Psychiatrist relies on Bantjies' "professional opinion"
4. Report finds "financial mismanagement"
5. Report recommends "curatorship"
6. Bantjies certifies implementation documents
7. Dan & Jax incapacitated, cannot challenge
8. Bantjies distributes R18M without oversight (May 2026)

**Timing Pattern**:
- July 2024: Bantjies appointed trustee
- 11 Aug 2025: Settlement (medical testing clause manipulated)
- 13 Aug 2025: Interdict filed (Bantjies provides false affidavit)
- Oct 2025: Medical testing (7 months before payout)
- May 2026: R18M payout

**Cui Bono**: Only Bantjies benefits (not Peter, not companies, not family)

**Mandatory Conditions**:
- No testing until AFTER May 2026 payout
- Bantjies removed as trustee or completely recused
- Party control (not attorney control) over professionals
- No automatic consequences
- R18M distribution cannot be conditioned on testing
