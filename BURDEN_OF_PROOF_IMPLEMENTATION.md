# Burden of Proof Workflow Test Implementation

## Overview

This implementation fulfills the requirement to "Test the workflow with sample tasks" while specifically addressing the agent instructions to implement optimal strategies for Dan & Jax to prove guilt of other agents (Peter, Rynette, Bantjies, etc.) across three legal standards.

## Agent Instructions Fulfilled

The implementation addresses all aspects of the agent instructions:

### ✅ Optimal Strategies Implementation
- **Comprehensive Framework**: Created `burden-of-proof-framework.js` with complete strategies
- **Target-Specific Approaches**: Individual strategies for Peter, Rynette, and Bantjies
- **Evidence Integration**: Links proof requirements to evidence collection
- **Tactical Planning**: Specific approaches for each legal standard

### ✅ Burden of Proof Standards

#### 1. Civil Standard - Balance of Probabilities
- **Threshold**: 50.1% probability
- **Requirement**: More likely than not that the allegation is true
- **Implementation**: Complete civil proof framework with evidence requirements
- **Sample Tasks**: 2 civil standard tasks targeting Peter and multiple parties

#### 2. Criminal Standard - Beyond Reasonable Doubt  
- **Threshold**: 95%+ certainty
- **Requirement**: Evidence that excludes reasonable alternative explanations
- **Implementation**: Complete criminal proof framework with enhanced evidence standards
- **Sample Tasks**: 1 criminal standard task targeting Rynette

#### 3. Mathematical Standard - Invariant of All Conditions
- **Threshold**: 100% logical certainty
- **Requirement**: Truth that holds under all possible conditions
- **Implementation**: Complete mathematical proof framework with logical requirements
- **Sample Tasks**: 1 mathematical standard task targeting Bantjies

### ✅ Necessary Conditions for Proving Guilt

The implementation defines specific necessary conditions for each target:

#### Peter (Fiduciary Duty & Financial Misconduct)
```
Civil: Duty → Breach → Causation → Damages
Criminal: Actus Reus → Mens Rea → All Elements → No Justification
Mathematical: Logical Premises → Valid Reasoning → No Counterexamples → Invariant Truth
```

#### Rynette (Conspiracy & Professional Misconduct)
```
Civil: Participation → Knowledge → Assistance → Harm
Criminal: Agreement → Overt Acts → Intent → Criminal Benefit  
Mathematical: Necessary Participation → Logical Impossibility of Innocence
```

#### Bantjies (Professional Malpractice)
```
Civil: Professional Duty → Standard Breach → Client Harm → Damages
Criminal: Criminal Assistance → Knowing Participation → Criminal Intent
Mathematical: Professional Role → Logical Necessity of Knowledge → No Innocent Explanation
```
