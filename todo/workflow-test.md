# Workflow Test Tasks

## Core Workflow Tests

### Must-Do (Critical Priority)

1. ~~Fix label array handling in GitHub Actions workflow~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Workflow uses secure array-based approach (lines 789-800)
2. ~~Add documentation for label format requirements~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - Updated docs/label-verification-guide.md with implementation details

### Should-Do (High Priority) 

1. Test the workflow with sample tasks
2. Verify proper issue creation with multiple labels

### Nice-to-Have (Low Priority)

1. Add metrics collection for workflow performance
2. Implement batching for large numbers of issues

### Improvements Needed:
- Create validation tests for workflow changes
- ~~Enhance error handling in issue creation process~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
- ~~Add comprehensive logging for debugging workflow issues~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Burden of Proof Strategy Implementation - Target Task

**Implement optimal strategies & indicate burden of proof and necessary conditions for Dan & Jax to prove guilt of other agents (Peter, Rynette, Bantjies, etc) in each element specified by the body of law being considered.**

### Must-Do Requirements
- must-do: Implement civil standard (balance of probabilities)
- must-do: Implement criminal standard (beyond reasonable doubt)  
- must-do: Implement mathematical standard (invariant conditions)
- must-do: Define necessary conditions for each agent and legal element

### Should-Do Enhancements
- should-do: Optimize evidence collection strategies for Dan and Jax
- should-do: Develop risk mitigation approaches against Peter, Rynette, Bantjies
- should-do: Create comprehensive documentation for guilt proof requirements

### Nice-to-Have Extensions
- nice-to-have: Advanced mathematical proofs for invariant conditions
- nice-to-have: Automated strategy optimization for burden of proof analysis
- nice-to-have: Interactive burden of proof calculator for different legal standards

## Improvements Needed
- Enhanced integration with existing legal framework
- Automated test generation for all Dan/Jax vs Peter/Rynette/Bantjies combinations
- Performance optimization for large case analysis
