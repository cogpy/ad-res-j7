# Burden of Proof Workflow Test

## Must-Do (Critical Priority)

1. Establish Peter's Fiduciary Duty Breach - Civil Standard
2. Document Rynette's Criminal Conspiracy - Criminal Standard

## Should-Do (High Priority)

3. Prove Bantjies' Professional Misconduct - Mathematical Standard
4. Test Multi-Party Civil Liability Framework

## Nice-to-Have (Low Priority)

5. Validate Evidence Chain Integration

## Implementation Notes

This test file validates that the workflow can process burden of proof tasks
for Dan & Jax to prove guilt of other agents across three legal standards:

- **Civil Standard**: Balance of probabilities (>50%)
- **Criminal Standard**: Beyond reasonable doubt (95%+)
- **Mathematical Standard**: Invariant of all conditions (100%)

### Target Parties:
- Peter (Fiduciary duty breaches)
- Rynette (Criminal conspiracy)
- Bantjies (Professional misconduct)

### Evidence Requirements:
Each task defines specific evidence requirements and success criteria
aligned with the applicable burden of proof standard.
