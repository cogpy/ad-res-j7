This role carries personal legal liability and non-delegable duties requiring continuous system access. The interdict creates an immediate regulatory crisis by preventing her from fulfilling these duties, risking:\n\n- Market access loss in 37 jurisdictions\n- Regulatory penalties (€10,000 to €1,000,000 per jurisdiction)\n- Personal criminal and civil liability\n- Business destruction (loss of international sales)\n- Consumer safety risks (inability to respond to safety inquiries or implement recalls)\n\nPeter's failure to disclose this critical information in the ex parte application constitutes material non-disclosure requiring the interdict to be set aside.\n\n**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours"

This timeline demonstrates:\n\n- The interdict was strategically timed for settlement leverage, not genuine urgency\n- Peter waited months after allegedly \"discovering\" issues before filing (June to August 2025)\n- The upcoming investment payout creates motive for Peter to gain control\n- No genuine urgency existed despite ex parte claims\n\n**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours"

Combined with the perjury evidence regarding email control, the case for void ab initio is extremely strong.",

The Phase 1 critical additions (11-16 hours of work) will address the most significant gaps and substantially strengthen the case. Full implementation across all phases will create an unassailable defense that leaves no allegation unanswered and no strategic angle unexploited.",
