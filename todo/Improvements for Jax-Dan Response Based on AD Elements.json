          "level": 4,
          "content": "**Introduction**\nThe Applicant failed to disclose to this Honourable Court that the First Respondent, Jacqueline Faucitt, holds the legally designated position of Responsible Person under EU Regulation 1223/2009 for cosmetic products distributed in 37 international jurisdictions. This material non-disclosure renders the ex parte interdict void ab initio, as the Court was deprived of critical information regarding the immediate regulatory crisis created by the interdict.\n\n**Legal Framework**\nUnder EU Regulation 1223/2009 and equivalent regulations in 37 jurisdictions where RegimA operates, a Responsible Person must be designated for all cosmetic products placed on the market. The Responsible Person has personal legal liability for:\n- Product safety and compliance with all applicable regulations\n- Maintaining product information files (PIFs) for all products\n- Ensuring proper labeling and packaging compliance\n- Responding to regulatory inquiries and market surveillance\n- Implementing corrective actions and product recalls if necessary\n- Maintaining continuous market access authorization\n\n**Non-Delegable Duties**\nThe Responsible Person role cannot be delegated or transferred without formal regulatory filings in each jurisdiction. The duties require:\n- Continuous access to product databases and compliance systems\n- Ability to respond to regulatory inquiries within statutory timeframes (often 24-48 hours)\n- Authority to implement corrective actions immediately\n- Access to financial systems to manage compliance costs and potential recalls\n\n**Immediate Crisis Created by Interdict**\nThe interdict granted on 19 August 2025 prohibits the First Respondent from accessing the very systems required to fulfill her non-delegable Responsible Person duties:\n- Product information databases\n- Compliance documentation systems\n- Regulatory correspondence and filing systems\n- Financial systems for compliance management\n- Communication systems for regulatory authorities\n\n**Regulatory Consequences**\nThe inability to fulfill Responsible Person duties creates immediate and severe consequences:\n\n1. **Market Access Loss**: Products may be removed from sale in all 37 jurisdictions\n2. **Regulatory Penalties**: Fines ranging from €10,000 to €1,000,000 per jurisdiction per violation\n3. **Personal Liability**: First Respondent faces personal criminal and civil liability\n4. **Business Destruction**: Loss of international sales (representing [X%] of total revenue)\n5. **Reputational Harm**: Regulatory non-compliance damages brand reputation irreparably\n6. **Customer Harm**: Inability to respond to safety inquiries or implement recalls endangers consumers\n\n**Material Non-Disclosure**\nThe Applicant knew or ought to have known of the First Respondent's Responsible Person role:\n- This role has been held for [X years]\n- It is documented in company records accessible to the Applicant\n- It is a fundamental aspect of the international business operations\n- The regulatory requirements are well-established and publicly available\n\nThe failure to disclose this critical information to the Court in the ex parte application constitutes:\n- Material non-disclosure requiring setting aside of the interdict\n- Possible fraud upon the Court\n- Abuse of ex parte procedure\n- Bad faith in seeking relief without full disclosure\n\n**Relief Required**\nThe interdict must be immediately set aside to prevent:\n- Irreparable regulatory harm\n- Personal criminal liability for the First Respondent\n- Business destruction\n- Consumer safety risks\n- International regulatory violations\n\n---"

However, it lacks the systematic, priority-driven structure and comprehensive evidence mapping present in the AD framework.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations—particularly the Phase 1 critical additions—the response will transform from a focused counter-attack into a comprehensive, multi-layered defense that:\n\n1. **Procedurally invalidates** the interdict through perjury and material non-disclosures\n2. **Substantively refutes** all allegations with detailed evidence\n3. **Offensively positions** Peter and his advisors as the wrongdoers\n4. **Protects** Jax and Dan's legitimate business operations and regulatory compliance\n5. **Systematically covers** all 50 AD paragraphs according to strategic priority\n\nThe Responsible Person regulatory crisis section alone may be sufficient to set aside the interdict, as it represents a critical material non-disclosure that deprived the Court of essential information in the ex parte application. Combined with the perjury evidence regarding email control, the case for void ab initio is extremely strong.\n\nThe enhanced structure ensures no allegation goes unanswered, no evidence goes unreferenced, and no strategic angle goes unexploited. This comprehensive approach maximizes the probability of success while positioning Jax and Dan as responsible business operators victimized by strategic litigation and information manipulation.",
